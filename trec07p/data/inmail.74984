The assignment to $1 and friends is local()ized to the current block:

"abc" =~ /.(.)./;
print "top level \$1=$1\n";
{
 "123" =~ /.(.)./;
 print "in block \$1=$1\n";
}
print "top level again \$1=$1\n";

once you leave the block in which the match occurred, the $1, $2, ... 
gets reassigned to whatever value it had before the block.
