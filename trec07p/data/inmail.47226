Hello,
My name is JOHN DRAKE, I am an American soldier attached to UN peace keeping force in Iraq. I am serving in the military of the 1st Armored Division in Iraq as well as the group commandant, as you know very well that everyday we are being attacked by bombs and gun bullets by Saddam Hussein's followers.

I managed to move funds belonging to Saddam Hussein's family in a consignment registered as Government Diplomatic Package and inssured by the International Guarantee bond (IGB).
The total amount is $21 Million us dollars. I want to move this money to you because Iraq is a war zone, so that you may invest it for me and keep my share in the bank of my choice. The percentage is 50% for me and 50% for you.This deal is 100% risk free.

If you are interested I will instruct the security company to deliver the consignment to you through a diplomat that work intermediary with United Nations Diplomats (UN). my fear is to find a good partner that i can trust and will assist me. Can I trust you? When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail signifying your interest including your most confidential email address for quick communication as i can not communicate with you on phone due to the war zone that i am presently in. Also your contact details where you would want the consignment delivered is needed.
Respectfully, 
John Drake.
