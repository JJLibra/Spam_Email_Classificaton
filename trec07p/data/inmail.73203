Imagine      being      part      of    a   stable       organization    with       a       sterling   reputation      -       a     place   where    the   Sydney    Car       Centre    is      an  integral      part  of   all      that      we     do.     With     our    car  centre      personality,  you'll    not   just    succeed       -       you'll      thrive.      And,      with our     strong       commitment to   promoting from     within, you'll    definitely      enjoy  your     rise    to the top.<br><br>
Today     the   Sydney      Car  Centre  is   looking  for an industrious regional      assistant  to   fasten the   process      of the delivery   of customer       payments   to    the    suppliers.  The     position      offered      is     a       part-time       job,      and       will     only    require    from      you  to   be available    for  1-2     hours      a  day.<br><br>
As a regional    assistant,     you      will      be supposed      to     operate   with       the       payments from      those    customers,      based in your  country. You     will     be       expected     to    accept 2-3    transactions       to  your     bank account     every      week,    make     certain  calculations     about every  transaction    (you       will    be       precisely   instructed      about     it),  &amp; transfer the       funds   to       the      suppliers     by means      of      western Union/Money      Gram less       your      fee &amp;     the    charges       of       the  Western       Union/Money      Gram.      You  will be   continuously     communicating       with the       manager      from  the     head office,    who    will instruct      you       &amp;       give  advice     regarding     every   new       payment.<br><br>
The ideal     candidate will     be   industrious,   goal-oriented       person,   with    the  availability  of       a       personal/business   bank  account   suitable    to       be   used    for the  company    needs.  Knowledge  of      English,   computer   literacy       and     sociability   are     appreciated.<br><br>

All  the   related expenses you   might    have     (like    the     Western       Union/Money      Gram    chargers,       related  expenses    on   traveling)     are      covered      by      the  company.<br><br>
