 Kill Bill  is the fourth film by writer director Quentin Tarantino. Originally
conceived as one film, it was released in two separate volumes  in Fall 2003 and
Spring 2004  due to its running time of approximately four hours. The movie is
an epic length revenge drama, with homages to earlier film genres, such as Hong
Kong martial arts movies and Italian Spaghetti Westerns  an extensive use of
popular music and pop culture references  and deliberately over the top
violence.

Kill Bill is the story of a professional assassin, initially identified only as
 The Bride , ref In Volume One, the main character is referred to only as  The
Bride.  Her real name is edited out when spoken.  ref  who works for a man named
Bill. Discovering she is pregnant with Bill s child, and despairing of the life
the little girl will lead if raised by her father, The Bride arranges her own
disappearance. Bill hunts her down, and on the day before she is to be married,
directs the massacre of her entire wedding party. Miraculously, she survives,
emerging from a coma four years later, her memory of the incident intact. She
proceeds to make a numbered  death list  of the assassins, ending with the name
 Bill,  and sets out to enact her revenge.

Plot Kill Bill is one story, divided into two volumes with five  chapters  each,
presented in anachronistic order  as is common among Tarantino s films .



Volume 1

The Bride  Thurman  is introduced to the audience in a blood spattered wedding
gown immediately after a violent showdown at a Texas wedding chapel. She
attempts to tell her would be killer, Bill  Carradine , that she is pregnant
with his baby, but he shoots her in the side of the head.

Four years later, The Bride arrives at the house of Deadly Viper Vernita Green
 Fox , codenamed [[Agkistrodon contortrix/Copperhead]]. Vernita and the Bride
engage in a brutal fight, with The Bride eventually dispatching Green in front
of her four year old daughter Nikki. She tells the girl that she s sorry for
killing her mom in front of her, and that if the young girl wishes to avenge her
death when she grows up, the Bride will be waiting. The Bride then leaves in a
yellow pick up truck.

A flashback to the events after the wedding reveals that the comatose Bride is
the only survivor of the massacre. Elle Driver, a.k.a. California Mountain
Snake, the one eyed assassin who has replaced the Bride as Bill s lover, slips
into the hospital ward intending to inject poison into the Bride s intravenous
line. She is stopped at the last second by Bill, who believes the Bride deserves
a more honorable death.

The Bride wakes up from her coma in the present and escapes from the hospital
after dispatching an orderly named Buck, who has been selling sexual access to
her body as she lay unconscious. She steals Buck s truck, the Pussy Wagon, and
hides in the back seat as she slowly works her limbs out of atrophy. In the back
of the truck, the Bride narrates the story of another Deadly Viper, O Ren Ishii
 Liu , codename  Cottonmouth. The events are shown in anime form. O Ren rose to
the top of the Japanese crime world as well as working as a highly paid
assassin. The segment introduces her personal bodyguard Go Go Yubari, her friend
and lawyer So</STYLE>
