US WA / Website   www.access.wa.gov /     Washington  is a state in the Pacific
Northwest region of the United States. The state is named after George
Washington, the first President of the United States. It is the only U.S. State
named after a president.

Washington was carved out of the western part of Washington Territory and
admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. In 2006, the Census Bureau
estimated the state s population at 6,395,798. Residents are called
 Washingtonians   emphasis on the third syllable, pronounced as tone .
Washington is sometimes called  Washington state  to distinguish it from
Washington, D.C., the US capital.

Geography Washington is the northwesternmost state of the contiguous United
States. Its northern border lies mainly along the 49th parallel, with the
Canadian province of British Columbia to the north. Washington borders Oregon to
the south, with the Columbia River forming most of the boundary and the 46th
parallel forming the eastern part of the southern boundary. To the east
Washington borders Idaho, bounded mostly by the meridian running north from the
confluence of the Snake River and Clearwater River  about 116  57  west , except
for the southernmost section where the border follows the Snake River. To the
west of Washington lies the Pacific
Ocean. ref [http   www1.leg.wa.gov LawsAndAgencyRules Constitution.htm
Washington State Constitution], Arcticle XXIV Boundaries  ref 

Washington is in the region known as the Pacific Northwest, a term which often
includes part or all of British Columbia in Canada and part of Alaska. Sometimes
it refers only to lands within the northwestern United States, including Oregon.

The high mountains of the Cascade Range run north south, bisecting the state.
Western Washington, west of the Cascades, has a mostly marine west coast climate
with relatively mild temperatures, wet winters, and dry summers. Western
Washington also supports dense forests of conifers and areas of temperate rain
forest. In contrast, Eastern Washington, east of the Cascades, has a relatively
dry climate with large areas of semiarid steppe and a few truly arid deserts
lying in the rainshadow of the Cascades  the Hanford reservation receives an
average annual precipitation of between six and seven inches. Farther east, the
climate becomes less arid. The Palouse region of southeast Washington was
grassland that has been mostly converted into farmland. Other parts of eastern
Washington are forested and mountainous.

The Cascade Range contains several volcanoes, which reach altitudes
significantly higher than the rest of the mountains. From north to south these
volcanoes are Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, and
Mount Adams. Mount St. Helens is currently the only Washington volcano that is
actively erupting  however, all of them are considered active volcanoes.

Washington s position on the Pacific Ocean and the harbors of Puget Sound give
the state a leading role in maritime trade with Alaska, Canada, and the Pacific
Rim. Puget Sound s many islands are served by the largest ferry fleet in the
United States.

Washington is a land of contrasts. The deep forests of the Olympic Peninsula,
such as the Hoh Rain Forest, are among the only temperate rainforests in the
continental United States, but the semi desert east of the Cascade Range has not
one single tree. Mount Rainier, the highest mountain in the state ref
name usgs  , is covered with more glacial ice than any other peak in the lower
48 states.

Park.

National forests in the state include Colville National Forest, Gifford Pinchot
National Forest, Mount Baker Snoqualmie National Forest, Okanogan National
Forest, Olympic National Forest, and Wenatchee National Forest, among others.

Other protected lands of note include Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area,
Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, Mount St. Helens National Volcanic
Monument, Ross Lake National Recreation Area, Lake Roosevelt National Recreation
Area, Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, among others administered by the
National Park Service.

There are many wilderness designated areas in Washington, including Alpi</STYLE>
