official census in 2000. Phoenix may have already overtaken Philadelphia in

During part of the 18th century, the city was the first capital and most
populous city of the United States. At that time, it eclipsed Boston and New
York City in political and social importance, with Benjamin Franklin taking a
large role in Philadelphia s rise. The city was the geographic center of the
18th century thinking and activity that gave birth to the American Revolution
and subsequent American democracy and independence. History


Colonial Before Europeans arrived, the Delaware  Lenape  Indian settlement of
Shackamaxon was located along the Delaware River. Although the area lay within

group built Gloria Dei Church, also known as Old Swedes .
