Start of article      Bolton  is a large town in the north west of England.
Located close to the West Pennine Moors, it is the largest settlement of the
Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in Greater
Manchester, ref [http //www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazzb.htm  Official
British Place Name Archives   Bolton ], Greater Manchester County Records Office
  URL accessed February 19, 2007. /ref  and has a total population of 139,403.

Historically part of Lancashire, Bolton rose to prominence during the 19th
century as a mill town centred on textile manufacture and cotton spinning. At
its zenith it was one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton
manufacture in the world.

Geography and administration Civic history In the early 19th century Bolton was
split into Great Bolton and Little Bolton with Little Bolton being approximately
the area North of the River Croal. The ancient parish of Bolton le Moors covered
a much wider area including many other townships.

On 11 January 1838 a Charter of Incorporation was drawn up by the councils of
Little Bolton and Great Bolton  on that day Bolton was incorporated as a
municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The election was
held on 30 November 1838 and Mr. Charles James Darbishire became the first
mayor. Other outlying areas were incorporated into Bolton later in the 19th
century   Rumworth in 1872 and in 1877 Tonge with Haulgh and Halliwell. The two
parts of Bolton continued to be known as Great Bolton and Little Bolton at least
until the end of the 19th century.

History Etymology The town s name,  in full, Bolton le Moors  has been recorded
over the years with many derivations of spelling including Bothelton, Boulton
and Bolton super Moras. However, the exact origins are not totally clear from
historical records.
[http //archive.boltoneveningnews.co.uk/2001/7/24/666518.html],
[http //archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/2003/6/28/545345.html]. There have been
three main hypotheses   one is that because of its location in the valleys of
confluencing moorland rivers, it is derived from  Bowl Town    another
suggesting it is a derivation from the Saxon words  bolt  and  tun , meaning
 arrow  and  stockade  respectively.[http //www.boltonrevisited.org.uk/77.html]
A final suggestion is from the words  boul  and  town , where boul means a
monument or central feature, though the boul itself is unidentified. A further
possibility is that  bol  derives from the Norse for farm and  ton  from the
Norse for town.

Early history Evidence of a Saxon settlement exists in the form of religious
objects found when the present Victorian parish church was built.

The town was given a Charter to hold a market in Churchgate in 1251 by King
Henry III of England. [http //www.bolton.org.uk/history.html]

Textile manufacture The town s position on the west of the Pennines provides a
damp climate. It is this feature which probably led to Flemish weavers, fleeing
the Huguenot persecutions in the 17th century, to eventually settle here, as moisture 
laden air allows for the spinning of cotton with little breakage. The cotton
industry was to provide the catalyst for the town s expansion between the 14th
and 19th centuries. Large, steam powered textile mills eventually dominated the
town s skyline, providing the major employment and defining the rhythm of the
working week, so much so that an annual shut down for maintenance in late June
became the Bolton Holidays. There were also some large iron foundries in the
town as well as other engineering works, many connected with the cotton
industry.

Bolton was Worktown in the Mass Observation project which has left us with many
photographs taken around the town by Humphrey Spender as part of that
project.[http //www.boltonmuseums.org.uk/html/spender/images.html]

 mouse]]

A /mouse/ /plural /mice// is a rodent that belongs to one of num

erous species of
small mammals. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse /Mu

s
musculus/. It is found in nearly all countries and, like the laboratory mouse,
serves as

 an important model organism in biology, and is also a popular pet. The
American white/foo

ted mouse /Peromyscus leucopus/ and the deer mouse
/[[Peromyscus maniculatus]]/ also somet

imes live in houses. These species of
mice live commensally with humans.

Although they ma

y live up to two years in the lab, the average mouse in the wild
lives only about 3 months

, primarily due to heavy predation. Cats, wild dogs,
foxes, birds of prey, snakes and even

 certain kinds of insects have been known
to prey heavily upon mice. Nevertheless, due to 

its incredible adaptability to
almost any environment, and its ability to live commensally

 with humans, the
mouse is regarded to be the third most successful mammalian species livi

ng on
Earth today, after humans and the rat.

Mice can be harmful pests, damaging and eati

ng crops and spreading diseases
through their parasites and feces. In the Western United S

tates, breathing dust
that has come in contact with mouse feces has been linked to the dea

dly
hantavirus. The original motivation for the domestication of cats is thought to
have b

een for their predation of mice and their relatives, the rats.


Body and behavior

Mice a

re small rodents, resembling diminutive rats. They usually have pointed
snouts and small e

ars. The body is typically elongated with slender, usually
hairless tails, but different t

ypes of mice show large variations. Body
dimensions vary considerably by species, though s

ome approximate values are
available/ total length 28/130 mm, mass 2.5 to /34g./ref name /

Mice generally live on an herbivore di

et, but are actually omnivores/ they will
eat meat, the dead bodies of other mice, and hav

e been observed to self/
cannibalise their tails during starvation. Grasshopper mice are a

n exception to
the rule, being the only fully carnivorous mice. Mice eat grains, fruits, a

nd
seeds for a regular diet, which is the main reason they damage crops. They are
also kno

wn to eat their own feces. Mice are generally thought to enjoy cheese
and people sometimes

 use it as mousetrap bait, but mice actually do not like
cheese due to its fatty texture. 

Instead, they like food that contains high
sugar, although chocolate is toxic to them./ref

Mice are social animals, preferring to live in groups. Male r

ivalry can become
harmful for the animals, especially when a group is confined to a small 

space.
The natural habitats of the mouse are very diverse. Mice can be found in
forests, s

avannahs, grasslands and rocky habitats./ref name / Novak// In Africa
they tend to particu

larly like forest edge, derived savannah, and /as elsewhere/
agricultural areas. Mice buil

d nests for protection and warmth, but species
differ in their preferences/ M. minutoides 

nests in shallow burrows/ M. caroli
and M. cervicolor burrow/ and M. shortridgei and M. pa

hari nest aboveground.
Most species will construct nests of grass, fibers, and shredded ma

terial./ref
name / Novak// Mice do hibernate.

The mouse has dichromatic vision, lacking a

 photopigment that can detect red
light./ref/Jacobs GH, Williams GA, Fenwick JA. Influence

 of cone pigment co/

ion Res.
2004/ 44/14//1615/22//ref/ There are diseases known to be spread by mice and
rats

 which include/

/ Rickettsial pox a disease similar to chicken pox and is spread to peopl

e by
  mites that are usually found on mice.

/ Rat bite fever is spread to people when th

ey are bitten by an infected mouse,
  rat or rodent.

/ Food poisoning /namely salmonellos

is/ is spread to people when food, food
  preparation surfaces or dishes are contaminated 

by saliva, urine or feces from
  a mouse.

/ Mice can spread parasites to people such as t

richinosis and tapeworms.

/ Hantavirus is a respiratory disease that is carried by small 

rodents,
  especially deer mice. It is spread to people when they breathe in dust that
  c

ontains the rodents infected saliva, urine or feces. Although uncommon,
  people can also 

get hantavirus if they are bitten by an infected mouse.

/ Plague is spread to people when

 they come in contact with fleas from infected
  rodents or when people are bitten by infe

cted rodents. However, today plague
  is usually spread to people by rodents like prairie 

dogs and squirrel

Taxonomy of the genus //Mus//

The term /mouse/ in common usage is roug

hly equivalent to the taxonomic term
Mus, while house mouse is equivalent to Mus musculus.

 In common language the
term /mouse/ often refers incorrectly to Mus musculus. However, th

ere are 38
species of mice /in the genus Mus// see table below.

Historically par/>rt of Lancashire, Bolton rose t< pr/>rominence duri<g the 19th
century as a mill town c/>centred o< textile manufacture and cot/>tton spinning< At
its/>s zenith i<t was one o/>of the largest and most productive<centres of cotton
manufacture in the /> world<.

Geography and administration Civic/> history In the early 19t< century Bolton was
split into Great Bo/>ol<ton and Little Bolton with Little Bolton/> bein< approximat/>tely
the area <orth of the River Croal. The ancie/>nt parish of Bolton le<Moors /> covered
a much wider area incl<ding ma/>ny other tow<nships.

On 11 J/>anuary 1838 a Charter of I<corporation was drawn up by the counc/>cils of
Little Bolton and Grea<t />Bolton< on that day Bolton was incorporated as /> a
municipal b<rough under th/>e Municipal Corporations Act 183<. The election was
held on 30 Novem/>mber 1838 an< M/>r< Charles James Darbishire /> became the first
mayor. Other outl<ing areas were incorporated into Bolton /> later in <he 19t/>th
century   Rumworth in 1872 an<d in 1877 To/>nge with<Haulgh and Halli/>well. The two
parts of Bolton continued< to be known as Great/> Bolton and Little< Bolton at leas/>t
until the end of the 19th <century.

History Etymology The/>e town s name,  in full, Bolton le Moo<s  /> has<been recorded
o/>over the years with many derivations of<spelling includ/>ing Bothelton, Boulton
and B<olton super Moras. However, t/>he exact origins are <not totally/> c<lear from
historical records.
[http ///>archive.boltoneveningnews.co.u<k/2001/7/24/666518./>html],
[htt<p //archi/>v<e.thisislan/>ncashire.co<uk/2003/6/28/54534/>5.html<]. There have been
three main hypoth/>heses   one is that <because of its location /> in th< valleys of
confluencing moorland rive/>rs, it <is derived from  Bowl Town    a/>another
<suggesting it is a derivation fr/>om the Saxon words  bolt  and  <un/>n , meaning
 arrow  and  stockade  res<ectively.[http //www.boltonrevisited/>d.org.uk/<7.html]
A fin/>nal sugges<ion is from the words  boul  and  t/>town , where boul <means a
monu/>ment or c<ntral feature, though the boul itself /> is unidentified. A further
possibi<ity is that  bol  derives from />the Norse for farm and  ton  from< the
No/>rs<e fo/>or town.

Early history<Evidence /> of a Saxon<settlement exists in the form of rel/>ligious
objects fou<d when the present Victorian pa/>arish chur<h was built./>

The town <was given a Charter to hold a market/> in Churchgate in 1251 by Ki<ng
Henry II/>II of England. [http //www.bolton.<rg./>.uk/history.html]

Textile manufacture T<e town/> s position on the wes<t of the Pennines provides a
damp clima/>ate. It is t<is feature which probably />led to Flemish weavers, fleeing
the Hug<uenot per/>rsecutions in th<e 17th century, to eventually se/>ttle here, as moisture 
la<den air allows for the /> spinning of cott<n with little breakag/>e. The cotton
industry was to< provide the cataly/>st for the town s expansion between the< 14th
and 19th centuries. Larg/>ge, steam powered tex<ile mills eventually domina/>ated the
t<wn s skyline, providing the major /> employmen< and defining the rhy/>ythm of the
working week, so much so tha< an annual shut down for maint/>tenance in late June
became the <olton Hol/>idays. There were also some< large iro/>n foundries in the
tow<n />as well as other engineering works, m<any connected with t/>he cotton
industry.

Bolto<n was Worktown/> in the Mass Observation pr<oject which has left us/> w<th many
photographs taken arou/>und the <town by Hum/>phrey Spende<r as part of that
project.[htt/>tp //www.boltonmuseums.org.uk/html</spender/images.html]
