"Stop calling my fucking phone!" he screamed, and hung up.  Boeing, which had 417 orders at the end of May versus 201 for Airbus, on Wednesday announced a $2.7 billion deal with Air France KLM for twin-aisle 777s and smaller 737s, but the deal was already in its books as an unidentified customer.

About 70,000 people have been killed in the more than two decades of fighting.
But our acoustic consultant warned us that an untreated floor could act like a giant drumhead, transmitting sound vibrations to our walls and hence to our ceiling. 

The market has cooled some since its peak in the late 1990s, when there were more than 400 initial public offerings a year.
