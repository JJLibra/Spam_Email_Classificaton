Dear valued member.
This letter is a part of the official program initiated by the United American Health Department – please, read it to the end if you regularly buy drugs on the Web.
No matter how wide the choice of meds is, always try to cling to generic ones. Moreover, it would be better to purchase them from reliable pharmacies, such as USDrugs. Don’t forget that the pharmacy you shop at should be licensed.
Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions concerning the information provided.
