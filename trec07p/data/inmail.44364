Dear customer.USA Web pharmacies are too expensive, Mexican Web pharmacies sell fake medications so what should we do in order to save some money without risking our health? Choose Canadian quality."High price proves the high quality of the drug" That's what all Web pharmacies say in their ads. All except CanadianPharmacy. Drug sales tax is much lower here in Canada so we don't have any trouble dumping our rivals into tears. CanadianPharmacy generic quality CAN be cheap.CanadianPharmacy 100% safety at the lowest price you've ever seen. Only generic drugs on sale.Sincerely yours,Son Winn
