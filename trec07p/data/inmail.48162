This syringe uses vacuum technology to suck the needle into the         plunger after use. The syringe cannot be reused once the vacuum is         activated. Rev Med believes its safety syringe has many advantages over         its competition including price, ease of use, and safety. It should help         reduce accidental needle stick injuries and also aid in reducing the         spread of contagious diseases. You may view a video of the syringe in         use on are website at <a target="_blank" href="http://amanuenis.com/cgi-bin/clickthru/6360/2370/92258" shape="rect">www.revolutionsmedical.com</a>.         The company also believes that with the help of government regulation         initiatives, individual state laws, and the importance of world health         concerns, the safety syringe market will continue to have substantial         growth into the foreseeable future. </p>

                      <p class="style14"> With the recent completion of Clear Image Acquisition Corp, Revolutions         Medical now controls exciting new software for MRI<span id="bwanpa0"></span>s         and PACS. After securing this break through technology, Rev Med<span id="bwanpa1"></span>s         second goal is to have test sites using this new software. Revolutions         Medical will then be able to introduce this product to the imaging         industry at the RSNA show in Chicago this fall. Revolutions Medical         believes its software will enable doctors to see MRI images in color and         3D using automatic segmentation. These tools should help in quicker,         more reliable diagnosis which will lower expenses and reduce time. The         imaging market is in the billions and growing. Revolutions Medical         believes that it will continue to grow as more and more uses are found         for the MRI segment of this market. A video of this new software can         also be found on our company's website. </p>
