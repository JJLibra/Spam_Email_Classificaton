 Avram Noam Chomsky   Hebrew and Yiddish                                  , Ph.D
 born December 7, 1928  is an American linguist, theorist, and political
activist. He is the Institute Professor Emeritus of linguistics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Chomsky is credited with the creation of
the theory of generative grammar, considered to be one of the most significant
contributions to the field of linguistics made in the 20th Century. He also
helped spark the cognitive revolution in psychology through his review of B. F.
Skinner s [[Verbal Behavior  book  Verbal Behavior]], in which he challenged the
behaviorist approach to the study of mind and language dominant in the 1950s.
His naturalistic approach to the study of language has also affected the
philosophy of language and mind  see Harman, Fodor . He is also credited with
the establishment of the Chomsky hierarchy, a classification of formal languages
in terms of their generative power. According to the Arts and Humanities
Citation Index in 1992, Chomsky was cited as a source more often than any other
living scholar during the 1980   1992 time period, and was the eighth most cited
scholar in any time period. ref [http //web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1992/citation 
0415.html  MIT News Office ] /ref  ref  According to a recent survey by the
Institute for Scientific Information, only Marx, Lenin, Shakespeare, Aristotle,
the Bible, Plato, and Freud are cited more often in academic journals than
Chomsky, who edges out Hegel and Cicero.  Samuel Hughes, The Pennsylvania
Gazette, July/August, 2001 [http //www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/200107  .htm
] /ref  ref name  robinson  Robinson, Paul  February 25, 1979 . The Chomsky
Problem  Chomsky. [[New York Times]]   Judged in terms of the power, range,
novelty and influence of his thought, Noam Chomsky is arguably the most
important intellectual alive today. He is also a disturbingly divided
intellectual.  /ref 

Beginning with his critique of the Vietnam War in the 1960s, Chomsky has become
more widely known     especially internationally     for his media criticism and
politics. He is generally considered to be a key intellectual figure within the
left wing of United States politics. Chomsky is widely known for his political
activism, and for his criticism of the foreign policy of the United States and
other governments. Chomsky has stated that  My personal visions are fairly
traditional anarchist ones, with origins in The Enlightenment and classical
liberalism  ref Chomsky, Noam,  Perspective on Power , Black Rose Books, 1997.
p.71 /ref  and he has praised libertarian socialism. ref  Chomsky, Noam,  Notes
on Anarchism  [http //www.zmag.org/chomsky/other/notes on 
anarchism.html]... Libertarian socialism is properly to be regarded as the
inheritor of the liberal ideals of the Enlightenment.  /ref  He is a sympathizer
of anarcho syndicalism. ref Chomsky wrote the preface to an edition of Rudolf
Rocker s book Anarcho Syndicalism  Theory and Practice. In it Chomsky wrote   I
felt at once, and still feel, that Rocker was pointing the way to a much better
world, one that is within our grasp, one that may well be the only alternative
to the  universal catastrophe  towards which  w are driving on under full
sail ....  Book Citation  Rudolph Rocker. Anarcho Syndicalism  Theory and
Practice. AK Press. p. ii. 2004. /ref   he is a member of the IWW .

Biography


Chomsky was born in the East Oak Lane neighborhood of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, the son of Hebrew scholar and IWW member William Chomsky, who was
from a town in Ukraine. His mother, Elsie Chomsky  born Simonofsky , came from
what is now Belarus, but unlike her husband she grew up in the United States and
spoke  ordinary New York English . Their first language was Yiddish, but Chomsky
says it was  taboo  in his family to speak it. He describes his family as living
in a sort of  Jewish ghetto , split into a  Yiddish side  and  Hebrew side ,
with his family aligning with the latter and bringing him up  immersed in Hebrew
culture and literature . Chomsky also describes tensions he personally
experienced with Irish Catholics and anti semitism in the mid 1930s, stating,  I
don t like to say it but I grew up with a kind of visceral fear of Catholics. I
knew it was irrational and got over it but it was just the street
experience.  ref</STYLE>

/Arcadia/ or /Arkad//a/ /Greek /////////////// see also List of traditional


Greek place names/ is a region of Greece in the Peloponnesus. It takes its name
from the m

ythological character Arcas.

Modern Arcadia Arcadia has its present/day capital at Tripol

i. It forms the
largest prefecture on the Peloponnesian peninsula. It currently covers abo

ut 18/
of the entire peninsula, although it once extended to about 20 to 25/ of the
penins

ula.

The prefecture has a skiing resort on Mount Maenalus, the Mainalon, located
about 20

 km NW of Tripoli. The other mountains include the Parnon in the
southeast, the Artemisio,

 the Saita, the Skiathio, the Lykaia and Tsiberou.

The Greek National Road 7 /E65/ highwa

y, which was extended after 1997 and in
2003, runs through Arcadia on a north/west to sout

h/east axis and nearly forms
in the southwest the end of the highway. A thermoelectric pow

er station which
produces electricity for most of southern Greece, operates to the south o

f
Megalopolis, along with a coal mine.

Arcadia has two tunnels. The Artemisio Tunnel open

ed first, followed by the
tunnel east of Megalopolis/ both serve traffic flowing between M

essenia and
Athens.

The chief cities and communities in the prefecture include Tripoli, A

stros,
Vytina, Dimitsana, Lagkadia, Leonidio, Leontari, Levidi, Megalopolis Paloumba
and S

temnitsa.

In agriculture, potato farms, mixed farming, olive groves, and pasture dominate


the plains of Arcadia, especially in the area around Megalopolis and between
Tripoli and 

Levidi.

Climate The climate consists of hot summers and mild winters in th

e eastern
part, the southern part, the low lying areas and the central area at altitudes
l

ower than 1,000 m. The area primarily receives rain during fall and winter
months in the r

est of Arcadia. Winter snow occurs commonly in the mountainous
areas for much of the west 

and the northern part, the Taygetus area, the
Mainalon.

History // by Nicolas Poussin.]]



Due to its remote, mountainous character, Arcadia has always been a classical
refuge. So 

during the Dorian invasion, when Mycenaean Greek was replaced with
Doric Greek along the c

oast of the Peloponnes, it survived in Arcadia,
developing into the Arcadocypriot dialect 

of Classical Antiquity. Arcadocypriot
never became a literary dialect, but it is known fro

m inscriptions. Tsan is a
letter of the Greek alphabet occurring only in Arcadia, shaped l

ike Cyrillic ///
it represents an affricate that developed from labiovelars in context whe

re they
became t in other dialects. Tsakonian Greek , still spoken on the coast of the
mod

ern prefecture of Arcadia, in the Classical period considered the southern
Argolid coast i

mmediately adjoining Arcadia, is a descendant of Doric Greek, and
as such is an extraordin

ary example of a surviving regional dialect of archaic
Greek. The capital of Tsakonia is t

he Arcadian coastal town of Leonidio.

One of the birth/places reported for Zeus is Mount 

Lycaeum in Arcadia. Lycaon, a
cannibalistic Pelasgian king, was transformed into a werewol

f by Zeus. Lycaon/s
daughter was Callisto. It was also said to have been the birthplace of

 Zeus/
son, Hermes.

Arcadia remained a rustic, secluded area, and its inhabitants became 

proverbial
as primitive herdsmen leading simple pastoral unsophisticated yet happy lives,


to the point that Arcadia may refer to some imaginary idyllic paradise,
immortalized by Vi

rgil/s Eclogues, and later by Jacopo Sannazaro in his pastoral
masterpiece, Arcadia /1504/

/ see also Arcadia /utopia/.

Arcadia later joined the Roman Empire and later the Byzantin

e Empire. In the early/
1st millennium, the area became a part of the Frankish Empire. In 

the mid/15th
century, the region fell into the hands of the Ottoman Turks with some

Biography


Chomsk<y/> was born in the East Oak Lane ne<ighbo/>orhood <f Phil/>ladelphia,
Pennsylvania, the son of Hebr<w scholar and IWW member Will/>liam Chomsky, who was
from a town i< Ukraine. His mother, Elsie Cho/>omsky  born Simonofsky , came from
what <is now/>w Belarus, but unlike her hus<and she gre/>w up in the United <tates and
spoke  ordinar/>y New York English . Their <irst language was Yiddish, but C/>Chomsky
sa<s it was  taboo  in his family t/>to speak it. H< describes his/>s family as livi<g
in a /> s<rt of  Jewish ghetto , /> split into a  Yid<ish/>h side  an<  Hebrew side ,
with his family aligni/>ing with the latter and bringing him <p  immersed />in Hebrew
cul<ture an/>d literature . Chomsky also describes< tensions/> he personally
experienced with Irish C<atholics and anti semitism in the/> mid 1930s, stating,  I
don t like< to say it but I gre/>ew up with a kind of<visceral fear of C/>atholics<. I/>
knew it was irratio<nal and got over it but it was just the />street
experience.  r<ef/>/></STYLE><p><HR width="90%" SIZE=1><p><center>
