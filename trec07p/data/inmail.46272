[[Procavia]] br [[Heterohyrax]] br [[Dendrohyrax]]    A  hyrax   from Greek
 shrewmouse   South African English   klipdassie   is any of four species of
fairly small, thickset, herbivorous mammals in the order  Hyracoidea . They live
in Africa and the Middle East.

Hyraxes are well furred rotund creatures with a mere stump for a tail. They are
about the size of a Corgi  most measure between 30 and about 70 cm long and
weigh between 2 and 5 kg. From a distance and with a little imagination, a hyrax
could be mistaken for a very well fed rabbit or guinea pig. They are not
predators.

Historical accounts

Early Phoenician navigators mistook the rabbits of the Iberian Peninsula for
hyraxes  Hebrew Shaphan   hence they named it I Shapan im, meaning  land of the
hyraxes , which became the Latin word  Hispania , the root of Spain s modern
Spanish name Espa  a and the English name Spain.

The word  rabbit  was used instead of  hyrax  many times in some earlier English
Bible translations. European translators of those times had no knowledge of the
hyrax  Hebrew Shaphan ref [http //www.htmlbible.com/sacrednamebiblecom/kjvstron 
gs/FRMSTRHEB82.htm S8227  Shaphan  in Strong s Concordance] /ref  , and
therefore no name for them. There are references to hyraxes in the Old Testament ref [http //www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search Lev+11 4 
8 Dt+14 7 Ps+104 18 Pr+30 26 Lev 11 4 8  Deut 14 7  Ps 104 18  Prov 30 26] /ref 
which seem to mistakenly identify hyraxes and rabbits as ruminating animals.
This is possibly because they  appear to be so from working the jaws on the
grasses they live on.  ref [http //www.ccel.org/ccel/jamieson/jfb.x.iii.xi.html x.iii.xi 
p5.1 Commentary on Lev. 11 5,6] by Robert Jamieson /ref  .

All modern hyraxes are members of the family  Procaviidae   the only living
family within the Hyracoidea  and are found only in Africa and the Middle East.
In the past, however, hyraxes were more diverse and widespread. The order first
appears in the fossil record over 40 million years ago, and for many millions of
years hyraxes were the primary terrestrial herbivore in Africa, just as odd toed
ungulates were in the Americas. There were many different species, the largest
of them about the weight of a small horse, the smallest the size of a mouse.

During the Miocene, however, competition from the newly developed bovids   very
efficient grazers and browsers   pushed the hyraxes out of the prime territory
and into marginal niches. Nevertheless, the order remained widespread, diverse
and successful as late as the end of the Pliocene  about two million years ago 
with representatives throughout most of Africa, Europe and Asia.

The descendants of the giant hyracoids evolved in different ways. Some became
smaller, and gave rise to the modern hyrax family. Others appear to have taken
to the water  perhaps like the modern capybara , and ultimately gave rise to the
elephant family, and perhaps also the Sirenians  dugongs and manatees . DNA
evidence supports this theory, and the small modern hyraxes share numerous
features with elephants, such as toenails, excellent hearing, sensitive pads on
their feet, small tusks, good memory, high brain functions compared to other
similar mammals, and the shape of some of their bones.

Hyraxes today , Tanzania]] Present day hyraxes retain a number of early mammal
characteristics  in particular they have poorly developed internal temperature
regulation  which they deal with by huddling together for warmth, and by basking
in the sun like reptiles . Unlike other browsing and grazing animals, they do
not have well developed incisors at the front of the jaw for slicing off leaves
and grass, and need to use the teeth at the side of the jaw instead. Unlike the
even toed ungulates and some of the macropods, hyraxes do not chew cud to help
extract nutrients from coarse, low grade leaves and grasses. They do, however,
have complex, multi chambered stomachs which allow symbiotic bacteria to break
down tough plant materials, and their overall ability to digest fibre is similar
to that of the ungulates.

Scientists have recently reduced the number of distinct species of hyrax
recognized. While as recently as 1995 there were eleven or more recognized
species, there are only four recognized today. The remaining species are
regarded as subspecies of the remaining four. In fact, there are over 50
recognized species and subspecies, though many are considered highly
endangered. ref name MSW3  /ref 

Relation to elephants

Though both are within the cohort of mammals known as Afrotheria, the hyrax is
not, as widely believed, the closest living relative of the elephant.  Elephants
 Proboscidea  and hyraxes  Hyracoidae  are both more closely related to manatees
and dugongs  Sirenia  than they are to one another.   ref [http //www.us.oup.co 
m/us/catalog/general/subject/LifeSciences/EvolutionaryBiology/?view usa ci 9780 
198507611] /ref  However, many classifications  both morphological and molecular
based  reveal the Sirenians as closest living relatives of elephants, while the
hyraxes are closely related but form an outgroup to the assemblage of elephants,
sirenians and extinct orders like Embrithopoda and Desmostylia. Citations would

 shrewmouse   South African /> English   klipdassie   is any of four s<ecies of
fairly small, thickset, her/>bivorous mammals in <the order  Hyraco/>oidea . The<y live
in Africa and the Middle East/>.

Hyraxes are well furred <rotund creatures with a me/>re stump for a tail. <They are
about t/>he size of <a C/>Corgi  most meas<ure between/> 30 and about 70 cm long and
<weigh between 2 /> <nd 5 kg./> From a distance and< with a little imagination, a hyrax
c/>could be mis<taken for a ver/>y well fed rabbit or guin<ea pig./> They are not
predators.

Historical acc<ounts

Early Phoenician navigator/>s mistook< the />rabbits of the Ib<rian Peninsula for
hyraxes  He/>brew Shaphan   hence they name<d it I Sha/>pan im, meaning  land of the
hyraxes< , which became the Latin />word  Hispania , the root of Spain s<modern
Sp/>panish nam< Espa  a and the English name Sp/>pain.

The wor<d  rabb/>it  was used in<stead of  hyrax  many times in som/>e< earlier English
Bibl/>le translations. <uropean translat/>tors of those times had no knowled<ge of the
hyrax  Hebrew Shaphan ref [h/>ttp //<ww.htmlbible.com/sacrednamebiblecom//>/kjvstron 
gs/FRMSTRHEB82.htm S8227 <Shaphan  in Strong s Conco/>ordance] /ref  , and
therefore no<name for them. There are references t/>to hyraxes in the Old Testament ref [ht<p //www.bible/>egateway.com/passage/?search Lev+1< 4 
8 Dt+1/>4 7 Ps+104 18 Pr+30< 26 Lev 11/> 4 8  Deut 14 7  Ps 104 18  Pro< 30 26] /ref 
which seem to/>o mistakenly identify hyraxes a<nd rabbits as ruminating animals.
Th/>is is possibly bec<use they  appear/>r to be so from worki<g the jaws on the
grasses they liv/>e on. < ref [http //>//www.ccel.or<g/ccel/jamieson/jfb.x.iii.xi./>html x.iii.xi 
p5.1 Co<mmenta/>ary on Lev. 11 5,6] by Rob<rt Jamie/>son< /ref  .

All modern hyraxes/> are memb<ers /> of the family  <Procaviidae   the only living
family wit/>hin the Hyraco<dea  and are found only i/>in Africa and the Middle East.
In the< past, howev/>ver, hyraxes we<re more diverse and w/>idespread. The order first
<appears in the fossil record ove/>r 40 million years ago, and f<or many millions of
years hyraxes were/> the pr<imary terrest/>trial herbivore in Africa, just as o<dd toed
ungulates were in the/> Americas. There were many diffe<rent species, the largest/>
of them about the weight of a<small ho/>orse<, the smallest the size of a mouse.

/>
During <he Miocene, however, c/>competition f<om the newly developed bovids   very
ef/>ficient grazers and browsers  <pushed the hyraxes out of /> the prime t<erritory
and into m/>arginal niches. Neverth<eless/>s, the o<de/>r remained widesp<ead, diverse
and successful as late as t/>the en<d of the Pliocene  about />two million years ago 
with repre<entatives throughout most of A/>Africa, Europ<e and Asia.

The descendants of the/>e giant hyracoids evolved i<n different ways. Some became
s/>maller, and gave<rise to the modern hyrax />family. Othe<rs appear to have taken/>
to th< water  perhaps like the modern capy/>ybara , and ult<imately gave ri/>se to the
elephant family, and perh<ps also the Sirenians  dugongs /> and man<ate/>es . DNA
evidence supports this< theory, and the small modern h/>yraxes s<are numerous
features with elephants/>s, such as toenails, <xcellent hearing, sensit/>tive pads on
their feet, smal< tusks,/>, good memory, high br<in functions compared to/> other
si<ilar m/>mammals, and the s<hape of some o/>f their bones.

Hyra<es t/>today , Tanzania]] Pres<nt day hyraxes retain /> a number of early mamma<
characteristics  in particula/>ar the< have/> p<oorly developed internal te/>mpera<ture
regulation  which they deal wit/>th by huddling together for warm<h, and by basking
in the sun like rept/>tiles . Unlike other browsin< and grazing ani/>imals, they do
no<t have well develope/>d incisors at the fro<nt of the/>e<jaw for slicing />off <leaves
and grass, and need to use the/>e teeth a< the side of the jaw instead. Unlike the/>
even< toed ungulates and some of th/>e macropods, hyraxes do not chew cud to <help
extract nutrients from coars/>e, low grade leave<s and grasses. They do, however/>r,
have complex, multi chambered stomach< which /> <llow symbiot/>tic bacte<ia to break
down tou/>ugh plant materials, and their overal<l ability to digest fibre is similar
to/> that of the ungu<lates./>

Scientists have recently reduced<the number /> of distinct species of hyrax
recog<nized/>.< While as recently as 199/>5 there were eleve<n or more recognized
s/>pecies, there are only four r<ecognized today. The remaining spec/>ies are
regarded as subspecies of the <emaining fou/>ur. In<fact, there are ove/>er 50
recognized species a<nd su/>ubspecies, thou<h many are considered highly
/>enda<gered/>d. ref <ame MSW3  /ref 

Relation to/>o elephants

Though bot< are within the cohort o/>of m<mmals kn/>n<wn as Afrotheria, the /> hyrax is
not, as widely believed, th<e closest living relative />of the elep<ant.  Elephants
 Probosc/>cidea  and h<yraxes  Hyracoidae  ar/>e both more clos<ly related to manatees
and d/>ugongs  Sirenia  <han they are to one another.   r/>ref [h<tp //www.us.oup.co/> 
m/us/catal<g/general/subject/LifeSci/>ie<ces/Ev/>volutionaryBiology/<view usa ci 978/>80 
198507611] /ref  However, many cla<ssificati/>ions  both morpho<ogical and molecular
based/>  reveal the Sire<nians as closest living relatives of ele/>phan<ts, while the
hyraxes are closely />related but form <an outgroup to/> the assemblage of elepha<nts,/>
sireni<ns />and <e/>extinct orders like Embrith<poda and Desmostylia. Citations w/>would
