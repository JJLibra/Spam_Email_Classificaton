<p><b><i>&ldquo;Do you see what I see?&rdquo;</i></b></p>
<p>It has now been a month since I directed my traders out of the market.&nbsp;  But we&rsquo;re not in hiding.&nbsp;  We&rsquo;re not following the crowd that lives by the mantra &ldquo;Sell in May and go away.&rdquo;&nbsp;  We&rsquo;re smarter than that.&nbsp;  And you are too.</p>
<a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK-3317975-8BM261-8BM261-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca"><img align="right" src="http://images.investorplace.com/e_images/jlhs/eplr_subscribe.gif" width="120" height="80" border="0" style="margin-left:8px;"></a>
<p>I fancy myself a magician &mdash; one who has not yet mastered pulling a white bunny out of a black top hat &mdash; but nonetheless a magician.&nbsp;  And I claim that only because I know the tricks of the market.&nbsp;  There are few people that can see behind the &lsquo;oohs&rsquo; and &lsquo;aahs&rsquo; and truly understand what is happening.</p>
<p>I am one of them.&nbsp;  But unlike a masterful magician who keeps his tricks to himself, I am more than willing to share.&nbsp;  In fact, I am begging for you to listen &mdash; and listen closely.</p>
<p>The market is doing just what I thought.&nbsp;  I am not backing down from my call of a correction.&nbsp;  I am still 110% sure that it will happen.&nbsp;  I&rsquo;m not a fortune-teller.&nbsp;  If I were, I could tell you what day and what time.&nbsp;  But I can tell you that there are things that have already happened or are currently evolving in the market that show a clear picture of the correction to come.</p>

<p><b>The Shorter They Were, the Harder They Fell</b></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk in the media lately about short interest, with short interest in the NYSE hitting record highs in May.&nbsp;  Many traders believe that high short interest is a bullish sign.&nbsp;  They assume that if short interest is at an all-time high, then the stock has already reached its low.&nbsp;  But that&rsquo;s a lie.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at two stocks on the NYSE: Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM) and Coeur d&rsquo;Alene Mines Corporation (CDE).&nbsp;  As of May 15, NEM has 16.7 million shares short, and CDE has 38.9 millions shares short.&nbsp;  Also, keep in mind that short interest in the NYSE has hit new highs for three months in a row, not just in May.&nbsp;  Did these new highs prevent the stocks from dropping?</p>
<p>No, it didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;  It turns out that both of them just hit new 52-week lows, with NEM dropping to $38.64 last Tuesday and CDE dropping to $3.47 last Friday.&nbsp;  The lesson to be learned: high short interest isn&rsquo;t bullish in itself, it just means there are more shorts in the stock.&nbsp;  The only time high short interest is bullish is when the stock is in an exceptionally bullish pattern that could break out&mdash;and even then, the only effect it will have is to exacerbate the move and make it faster than it would be otherwise.</p>
<p>High short interest alone is not enough of a reason to buy&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not stopping stocks from hitting the 52-week low list.</p>
<p>There are plenty of myths like this in the market.&nbsp;  Let me be your guide to what is really going on &mdash; it&rsquo;s all there in the charts!&nbsp;  <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK-3317975-8BM261-8BM261-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca">Sign up for <em>Trending123</em> today.</a></p>

<p><b>12 Charts Show Us the Way</b></p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m going to give you access to a special alert I sent to my <em>Trending123</em> members last week, explaining all of the different pieces of the puzzle and how they are coming together to paint the picture of &ldquo;Correction, Dead Ahead!&rdquo;</p>  
<p><a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSHS0529-3317975-8BM261-8BM261-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca">Watch it now</a> to learn about all of the different factors I&rsquo;m tracking and how they are going to affect your portfolio, including:</p>
<ul type="square" style="color:#006600;">
	<li><span style="color:black;">Why the rally in unleaded gas (and only unleaded gas) is a danger sign</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:black;">Two examples of carry trades fixing to unwind</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:black;">How the QID (the inverse to the NASDAQ&rsquo;s QQQQ) is going to help us profit off the reverse symmetrical triangle (RST)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:black;">A look at the Bullish Percent Index for the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P500 &mdash; the market may be making new highs, but it is forgetting to take stocks with it!</span></li>

	<li><span style="color:black;">Six other charts and the stories that they are telling me right now.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>I cannot say this strongly enough &mdash; all the evidence still points to a correction.&nbsp;  And yes, I do feel a little bit like I&rsquo;m stuck out on an island yelling &ldquo;correction&rdquo; while everyone else parrots &ldquo;new highs, new highs.&rdquo;&nbsp;  All I can tell you is, they aren&rsquo;t looking at the whole picture.&nbsp;  But you can be.&nbsp;  <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSHS0529-3317975-8BM261-8BM261-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca">Watch my special alert on what is happening in the market today.</a></p>
