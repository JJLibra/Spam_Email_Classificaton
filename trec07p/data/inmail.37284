<p><b>The Tell-Tale Charts</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard not to be bullish when the market has shot back up after every pullback recently.&nbsp;  But when everyone says it&rsquo;s going to the moon, that&rsquo;s when we need to look under the hood and see if a rally is really healthy.&nbsp;  Right now, all the indicators are pointing south.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Though prices have risen, the MACD histogram shows negative buying pressure.&nbsp;  That&rsquo;s a sign they won&rsquo;t be rising much longer.</li>
	<li>The Average Directional Index (ADX) which measures the strength of a trend on a scale of 0 to 100, is at 13.29.&nbsp;  That&rsquo;s not just weak, it&rsquo;s in critical condition!</li>
	<li>Stocks that led the rally up, like CTSH, ISRG, MIDD, TTEC, are tanking.&nbsp;  So who&rsquo;s leading the rally now?</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this and more shows the market is topping.&nbsp;  Remember, as technical traders, we don&rsquo;t trade the top 10% or the bottom 10%.&nbsp;  We only trade the middle.&nbsp;  That means at times like this, we take a step back and limit ourselves to inverse funds and start working on a list of shorts.&nbsp;  <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK-3317975-8BM195-8BM195-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca">Join <em>Trending123</em>, and you can make money no matter which way the market is going.</a></p>

<p>A fever is spreading across Wall Street.&nbsp;  A fever that is causing false hope in its victims.</p>
<p>You may, in fact, be one of them.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t blame yourself for believing in the market fa&ccedil;ade.&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s perfectly natural to want to see the best.&nbsp;  After all, it is springtime.&nbsp;  Flowers are blooming, birds are a chirpin&rsquo; and the warm sun is a shinin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Now I hate to be the storm cloud blocking your sunny disposition here, but everything isn&rsquo;t as lovely as they&rsquo;d have you believe.</p>
<p>There are so many indications that this market is more sour than sweet that it&rsquo;s more than a little baffling that I seem to be one of the very few people talking about it.&nbsp;  Repeatedly.&nbsp;  And I will continue to shout about the real story until more people start paying attention.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m not just spouting off ideas and assumptions just to hear myself talk.&nbsp;  I&rsquo;m looking at real-time charts that are the true indicators of everything you&rsquo;d ever need or want to know about how the market performed in the past, how it is performing right now and how I see it unraveling in the near future.&nbsp;  <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK-3317975-8BM195-8BM195-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca">Look at the most recent charts with me &mdash; try <em>Trending123</em> with this special offer today.</a></p>

<p><b>WHEN THE STORM HITS&hellip;</b></p>
<p>Will your portfolio plummet or will you be in the stocks that profit?</p>
<p>All the market charts &mdash; from the NASDAQ&rsquo;s &ldquo;QQQQ&rdquo; to the S&amp;P 500, and so on &mdash; point to an impending calamity for most investors.&nbsp;  The Dow could drop as much as 2,000 points from here.</p>
<p>But if you give me just a few minutes of your time &mdash; I could save you many thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>So far this year, at <em>Trending123</em>, we have closed 67 short-term trades and 78% of them have been winning trades.&nbsp;  On an annualized basis, we&rsquo;re averaged 114% gains on each one of those trades!</p>

<p><b>Perception Vs Reality</b></p>
<p>Okay, look, let me explain what I mean about the market.</p>
<p>Imagine the market is a used car.</p>
<p>So there it is on the lot &mdash; brightly polished, everything in its place.&nbsp;  Just about perfect to the naked eye.</p>
<a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK-3317975-8BM195-8BM195-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca"><img align="right" src="http://images.investorplace.com/e_images/jlhs/eplr_subscribe.gif" width="120" height="80" border="0" style="margin-left:8px;"></a>
<p>But as anyone who has ever bought a used car will tell you, you must look under the hood. One look under there and what once seemed like your perfect car may have just become a junker that you&rsquo;re grateful you didn&rsquo;t purchase!</p>
<p>Now look at the market as if it were this used car. Catch my drift?</p>
<p>This market can appear like nothing at all is wrong &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; but that my friends, would be a terribly wrong assumption to make.</p>

<p><b>We are experiencing a Frontrunner Collapse!</b></p>
<p>Many frontrunner stocks are practically flashing their crumbling states in bright neon.&nbsp;  And yet no one seems to be paying attention.</p>

<div style="background-color:#FFFFCC; padding:10px;">
	<p style="margin-top:0;">Take these 6 as examples:</p>
	<ol type="1">
		<li><b>Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH)</b> &mdash; a frontrunner in a complete freefall (currently falling below the 200 EMA)!</li>
		<li><b>Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG)</b> &mdash; It broke out of its rising wedge pattern on bearish divergence.&nbsp;  Indicators are pointing <i>straight down</i>.</li>
		<li><b>Middleby Corp. (MIDD)</b> &mdash; This has gone from the 146 mark down to 125 over the past few weeks while the market is supposedly holding up well. What??!!</li>
		<li><b>Millicom International Cellular SA (MICC)</b> &mdash; Indicators are pointing down on bearish divergence&hellip;this one could roll over at any moment.</li>
		<li><b>TeleTech Holdings Inc. (TTEC)</b> &mdash; Back in April, this was topping but now it&rsquo;s taking a serious nosedive on massive volume.</li>
		<li><b>Amgen Inc. (AMGN)</b> &mdash; I can&rsquo;t even talk about this one.&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s just too scary!</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<p>Okay, now you have seen behind the magic curtain.&nbsp;  You know what is really happening in the market.&nbsp;  Do not turn a blind eye or a deaf ear any longer.</p>
<p>Pay attention.&nbsp;  Don&rsquo;t just see what &ldquo;they&rdquo; want you to see.&nbsp;  <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK-3317975-8BM195-8BM195-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca">See more of the truth right now &mdash; try my <em>Trending123</em> service at a special rate.</a></p>
