Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.





Erectile dysfunction (ED), 
sometimes referred 

to as impotence, is the inability 
for a sexually active male to obtain 

and sustain an erection for sexual
 purposes. In the past, this has been 

very embarrassing for
 men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 



and, in fact, there has been very

 little diagnostic testing or treatment

 options available 
until very recently.
