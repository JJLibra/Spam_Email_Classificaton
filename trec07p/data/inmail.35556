"All you gotta do is hit the right niche, and you're well on your way to being a millionaire!" - Ken C. USA Today Quote



What is an online real estate developer?

An online real estate developer is someone who acquires domane names as an investment in its future value. 

To maximize return on investment, internet real estate developers sometimes link web pages and content to each domane name. 



http://lookedleftlast.com/t/c/48477/av/cz108934.html 



Why Invest in online real estate? 

The average return on domane names is 377% which isn't bad, but it's not the best reason to invest!



There are obvious signs pointing to a huge internet (domain) land rush, and has to do with the fact that Google 

and other major search engines are running out of valuable online real estate! 



Google has said it themselves in a recent press releases after they decided to get into 

the domane name registration business, and wants to "learn" what they can the about business! 



Shortly thereafter, Google made the single largest purchase of online real estate in history 

when it bought YouTube.com for 1.8 Billion! In very recent news, 

a 22 year old quit college and starting working from home in 2004, 

and just turned down an offer from Yahoo for 1 billion! 



The future is very bright but the window is going to close as fast as it opened.
