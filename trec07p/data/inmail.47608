History

The first Europeans in what would become Pittsburgh arrived in the 1710s as
traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to pen a report on the forks of the
Ohio in 1717. About this same time trading camps boasted the first settlers in
the area. In 1749 French soldiers from Quebec launched a serious expedition to
the forks in hopes of uniting French Canada with French Louisiana via

General Braddock and Colonel George Washington, then a successful campaign led
by General John Forbes against the French at Pittsburgh. After having the French
surrender Ft. Duquesne in 1758, he ordered the construction of Fort Pitt, named
after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder. He also named the
settlement between the rivers  Pittsborough.  ref name  Lorant    ref
