 Whale watching  is the practice of observing whales and other cetaceans in
their natural habitat. Whales are watched most commonly for recreation  cf. bird
watching  but the activity can also be for scientific or educational reasons.
Whilst individuals do organize private trips, whale watching is primarily a
commercial activity, estimated to be worth up to $1billion per annum worldwide
to whale watching operations and their local communities. The size and rapid
growth of the whale watching industry has led to complex and unconcluded debates
with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.

History Whale watching as an organized activity dates back to 1950 when the
Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego was declared a public spot for the
observation of Gray Whales. In 1955 the first water based whale watching
commenced in the same area, charging customers $1 per trip to view the whales at
closer quarters. The spectacle proved popular, attracting 10,000 visitors in its
first year and many more in subsequent years. The industry spread throughout the
western coast of the United States over the following decade.

In 1971 the Montreal Zoological Society commenced the first commercial whale
watching activity on the eastern side of North America, offering trips in the
St. Lawrence River to view Fin and Beluga Whales.

In the late 1970s the industry mushroomed in size thanks to operations in New
England. By 1985 more visitors watched whales from New England than California.
The rapid growth in this area has been attributed to the relatively dense
population of Humpback Whales, whose acrobatic behaviour such as breaching
 jumping out of the water  and tail slapping was an obvious crowd pleaser, and
the close proximity of whale populations to the large cities on the east coast
of the US.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s whale watching spread throughout the world. In
1998 Erich Hoyt carried out the largest systematic study of whale watching yet
undertaken and concluded that whale watching trips were now available in 87
countries around the world, with over 9 million participants generating an
income to whale watcher operators and supporting infrastructure  such as
accommodation, restaurants and souvenirs  of over one billion dollars. His
estimate for 2000 was for 11.3m participants spending $1.475bn, representing a
five fold increase over the decade.

Whale watching is of particular importance to developing countries as coastal
communities start to profit directly from the whales  presence, significantly
adding to popular support for the full protection of these animals from any
resumption of commercial whaling.

Today

Whale watching today is carried out from the water from crafts from kayaks,
motorized rafts, and sailboats through to out of use fish or whaling boats and
custom built craft carrying as many as 400 people. Land based watching of
species such as the Orca who come very close to shore remains popular. Viewing
of species that usually stay some distance from the shore is also offered by fixed 
wing aircraft or helicopters in some areas.

Whale watch trips may last one hour, two hours, half a day, a full day, two or
three days, or on up to ten or fourteen days. You may spend as little as $7 or
$8 per person for an hour long trip or more than $3,000 for a two week
expedition with several stops. Vessels listed in this book include large
excursion boats, small excursion boats, fishing boats, small motor craft,
sailboats, motorized rafts, and sea kayaks.

Naturalists on Board

Some trips are strictly for pleasure, some are research oriented, and some
successfully combine both elements. Many whale watch tours are family run
businesses  some are sponsored by scientific institutions and research
organizations. A word is in order about the nature of  naturalists  on board.
The term generally refers to the person or persons who narrate the whale watch
trips, providing educational information about the whales, their behaviors and
habitat, and about the other creatures that share the marine environment. Some
naturalists are marine biologists or oceanographers. Some are affiliated with,
and trained by, research organizations and scientific institutions. On some
trips, narration is provided by knowledgeable captains, people who have been
going to sea with whales for years and have made a point of educating themselves
so they can answer passengers  questions correctly. On some trips where no
narration is provided, tour operators show an educational video on whales and
hand out written materials provided by whale conservation organizations.
Probably it is unwise to judge a trip s worth based solely on whether or not a
naturalist is on board.

Booking passage on a whale watch trip    with or without a naturalist    is no
reason not to educate yourself before you get on the boat. Many wonderful books
about whales and whale biology are in print, available at libraries and
bookstores all over the country.

Choosing a Trip

In any given area, the tour boats tend to go to the same places, sometimes
staying in radio contact with one another in case someone sights whale</STYLE>

/It Happened One Night/ is a 1934 

romantic comedy directed by Frank Capra, in
which a pampered socialite /Claudette Colbert/

 tries to get out from under her
father/s thumb, and falls in love with a roguish reporter

 /Clark Gable/. The
plot was based on the story [[Night Bus]] by Samuel Hopkins Adams, whi

ch
provided the shooting title.

One oddity is the title/ the movie takes place over sever

al nights and none is
particularly key to the plot.

Plot

Spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews /

Colbert/ marries fortune/hunter /King/ Westley
/Jameson Thomas/ against the wishes of her 

extremely wealthy father /Walter
Connolly/. He retrieves his daughter before the marriage 

can be consummated, but
then she runs away, leaping off the side of the family yacht.

She

 boards a bus, where she meets Peter Warne /Gable/, an out/of/work newspaper
reporter. He 

recognizes her and gives her a choice/ if she will give him an
exclusive on her story, he 

will help her reunite with King, otherwise he will
tell her father where she is and collec

t the reward. She agrees.

Various adventures follow. One of the most famous happens when 

they have to
hitchhike. Peter claims to be an expert on the subject, but nothing works and


eventually, out of frustration, he ends up thumbing his nose at passing cars.
The shelter

ed Ellie then shows him how it/s done. She stops the next car dead in
its tracks by liftin

g up her skirt and showing off a shapely leg.

One night, when they are nearing the end of

 their journey, Peter leaves to make
some arrangements. The owners of the auto court in wh

ich they are staying see
that his car is gone and assume he has left without paying. They 

roust Ellie out
of bed and kick her out. Believing Peter has deserted her, Ellie calls her


father, who is so relieved to get her back that he agrees to let her have her
way. Ellie 

has fallen in love with Peter, but she thinks he betrayed her for the
reward money, so she

 agrees to have a second, formal wedding with King.
Meanwhile, Peter believes he/s the one

 who/s been double/crossed.

Peter gets in touch with Ellie/s father to settle up. Mr Andr

ews offers him the
large reward promised, but Peter will have none of it. He just wants to

 be paid
$39.60 for the expenses incurred on the trip. Intrigued, the father badgers the
r

eporter until he gets the truth/ Peter loves Ellie /though he thinks he/s out
of his mind 

to do so/. Peter leaves with the check he asked for.

While walking his daughter down the 

aisle, Andrews tells her what he has found
out and encourages her to run off again/ at the

 last moment, she does. Her
father pays off Westley, who agrees to have the marriage annul

led, enabling
Ellie to marry Peter.

Awards The film was the first to win all five major A

cademy Awards/ /Best
Picture / Columbia Pictures /Harry Cohn, producer/ /Best Actor in a L

eading Role
/ Clark Gable /Best Actress in a Leading Role / Claudette Colbert /Best Direct

or
/ Frank Capra /Best Writing, Adaptation / Robert Riskin

This feat would not be matched

 until [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo/s Nest
/film//One Flew Over the Cuckoo/s Nest]] /1975/ a

nd later by [[The Silence of
the Lambs /film//The Silence of the Lambs]] /1991/.

After fi

lming was completed, Colbert complained to her friend, /I just finished
the worst picture 

in the world.//ref/[http///www.moviediva.com/MD_root/reviewpa/

m moviediva ItHappenedOneNight]//ref//ref///ref/. In
1935, after her Academy Award nominat

ion, Colbert decided not to attend the
presentation and instead, planned to take a cross/c

ountry train trip. After she
was named the winner, studio chief Harry Cohn sent someone to

 drag her off the
train, which had not left the station, and take her to the ceremony. Col

bert
arrived wearing a two/piece traveling suit that she had Paramount Pictures
costume de

signer Travis Banton make for her trip./ref/Sharon Fink, Oscars/ The

After her acceptance speech at th

e Oscars ceremony, she went back on stage and
thanked Capra for making it.

On December 15

, 1996, Clark Gable/s Oscar was auctioned off to Steven Spielberg
for $607,500/ Spielberg 

promptly donated the statuette to the Motion Picture
Academy[http///www.liveauctiontalk.co

On June 9th of the following year, Colbert/s Osc

ar was offered for auction by
Christie/s. No bids were made for it.

The movie has also be

en selected for preservation in the United States National

Whale watching today <is carrie/>d out from the water from cr<afts from kayaks,
moto/>orized rafts, and sailboats through to <ut /> of use fish or w<haling boats and
custom/> built craft carrying as many as 400 p<eople. Land based wat/>tching of
species such< />as the Orca who come ver<y close to shore remai/>ins popular. Viewing
of species that <usuall/>y stay some distance f<om the shor/>e is also offered by f<ixed 
wing aircraft or he/>elicopters in some areas.

Whale watch t<ips may last one hour, two hours/>s, half a day, a ful< day, two or
three days,/>, or<on up /> to ten or fou<teen/>n days. You ma<y spend as />little <as $7 or
$8 per person/>n for an hour l<ng trip or more than $3,000 for />a two week
expedition with< several stops. Vessels/> listed in this <book include large
excursion boats,/> small excursion bo<ats, fishing boats, small motor craft,/>
sailboats, motori<zed rafts, and sea k/>kayaks.

Nat<ralists on Boar/>rd

Some trips are< strictly for pleasure, so/>ome are research oriented, and some<successfully combine both />elements. Many whale watch< tours are fa/>mily run
businesses  so<me are spons/>ored by scientific institutions and< research
organizations. /> A word is in ord<r about the nature of  naturalist/>ts  on board.
The term generally refe<s to the person or persons who narrate/>e th< wh/>ale watch
trips, providing educa<ional informatio/>on about the whales, their behavio<s and
habitat, and /> about the other creatures that share <he marine/> environment. Some
naturalist<s are marine biologists or oceanograph/>ers. Some are affiliated with,
a<d traine/>d by, <esearch organizations and scien/>ntific institutions. On< some
t/>rips, narration is provided by knowl<edgeable captains, people who have been
/>going to sea with whales<for years and have made/>e a point of ed<cating themselves
so they can an/>swer pass<engers  questions correctly. On s/>some trips where no
narra<io/>n is provided, tour <operators show an /> educati<nal v/>ide<o on whales and
hand out written mat/>erials provided by wh<le conservation organiza/>ations.
Probably it is<unwise to judge a trip s worth />based solely on whether o<r not /> a
naturalist is on board.

Bookin< pass/>sage on a whale watch trip    with<or/> without a naturalis<t    is no
reaso/>on not to educa<e yourself before you get on the boa/>t. Many w<onderfu/>l books
abo<t /> whales and whale bi<ology are in print, availa/>a<le at libraries and
bookstores all over /> the country.
