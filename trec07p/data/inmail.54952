<p><font   face="sans-serif">While    we may    have high       expectations       of      our associates,    we    also   give  them     high  rewards.  Imagine    being    part of      a stable       organization       with     a       sterling reputation  - a     place   where      the     Sydney    Car Centre  is      an  integral       part      of  all  that  we do.       With   our  car     centre     personality, you'll       not  just      succeed     -    you'll      thrive.     And,       with     our strong      commitment  to   promoting     from     within,    you'll      definitely     enjoy    your rise      to  the  top.<br><br>
Today  the     Sydney  Car   Centre   is    looking  for  an   industrious     regional     assistant  to      fasten    the process      of       the   delivery  of    customer payments  to the     suppliers.  The position offered   is     a part-time  job,  and  will only       require  from  you       to      be       available   for 1-2      hours     a      day.<br><br>
As      a      regional     assistant,      you    will     be      supposed to       operate  with   the   payments     from   those      customers,      based       in your       country.      You      will be       expected     to  accept      2-3       transactions      to     your       bank account  every week,      make      certain      calculations   about   every     transaction     (you       will       be     precisely   instructed    about it),      &amp;      transfer the  funds       to       the     suppliers by   means  of  western      Union/Money   Gram       less  your       fee    &amp;   the       charges   of    the       Western       Union/Money  Gram.       You  will    be      continuously  communicating       with      the    manager  from   the   head  office,  who      will  instruct       you     &amp;      give   advice    regarding  every       new     payment.<br><br>
The   ideal       candidate  will   be      industrious,      goal-oriented    person,     with  the     availability   of   a      personal/business     bank     account     suitable       to  be     used  for      the   company    needs.  Knowledge     of  English,    computer     literacy    and     sociability      are    appreciated.<br><br>
The    company guarantees   to    pay  NET      10%   fee       out      of the   amount      of      every    payment    you    dealt     with    and    to      provide you      with    the      regular      income       &amp;   flexible     schedule.    All  the   related    expenses    you     might      have       (like the       Western       Union/Money   Gram    chargers, related  expenses       on    traveling)  are  covered   by     the     company.<br><br>
