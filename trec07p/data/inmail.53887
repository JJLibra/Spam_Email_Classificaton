Imagine being     part       of a   stable  organization     with   a  sterling reputation     -      a  place   where   the      Sydney    Car       Centre       is   an      integral part     of    all  that      we    do. With    our     car       centre   personality,   you'll       not  just   succeed      -     you'll  thrive.    And,       with    our      strong   commitment     to     promoting   from   within,       you'll       definitely  enjoy    your       rise   to    the top.<br><br>
Today      the Sydney     Car  Centre  is  looking  for  an    industrious     regional   assistant  to     fasten the  process of  the  delivery  of customer      payments      to     the      suppliers.    The       position     offered     is    a  part-time       job,      and      will only       require from  you   to    be  available       for     1-2    hours     a   day.<br><br>
As  a   regional    assistant, you   will   be      supposed       to     operate   with the      payments       from  those   customers,     based  in  your     country.       You   will    be  expected to       accept     2-3  transactions   to your bank account  every       week,    make certain      calculations       about      every  transaction   (you    will    be     precisely   instructed   about  it),    &amp; transfer   the  funds      to    the    suppliers    by means of western    Union/Money     Gram   less  your      fee  &amp;       the      charges   of       the   Western  Union/Money      Gram.  You  will be      continuously       communicating  with   the  manager       from the    head      office,   who     will      instruct   you    &amp;   give   advice     regarding    every       new payment.<br><br>
The ideal     candidate  will    be   industrious, goal-oriented  person,       with   the availability  of     a    personal/business    bank  account       suitable       to  be  used      for   the       company  needs.     Knowledge       of     English,      computer literacy and   sociability  are     appreciated.<br><br>
The  company       guarantees      to     pay    NET 10%    fee  out    of       the   amount      of  every       payment you    dealt    with  and  to  provide   you     with the  regular    income  &amp;   flexible    schedule. All the   related    expenses     you might    have       (like the   Western  Union/Money    Gram chargers,   related expenses       on     traveling) are  covered   by    the  company.<br><br>
