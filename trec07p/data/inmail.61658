As an administrator, you might want to keep an eye on the directories =
under Temporary ASP.
Since this column is about extending Team System, I won't be covering =
the details related to hooking the code into the Word infrastructure, =
but all the code will be provided for you to see. If you create a Team =
Project without defining the source control folder, a valid option when =
using the New Team Project wizard, you will receive a Microsoft.
To mimic the Microsoft version, I added some additional helper methods =
to the tfsvcUtil class: GetAllProjects and GetFolders.
New tools, libraries, and paradigms will change how you build managed =
apps, offering powerful possibilities.
To perform the actual checking, you need to query the Workspace for a =
list of pending changes using the GetPendingChanges method. The core set =
of APIs the add-in uses to interact with Team Foundation Server are =
contained in three assemblies installed as part of a Team Explorer =
installation.
The top-level element of this visual tree is a Border, an element that =
can play parent to a single child. The pain of control customization has =
evidently been felt by the developers of the Windows Presentation =
Foundation, available as part of the . GetFolders uses the GetItems =
method of the VersionControlServer object to get a single level of =
folders for the provided path. That fraction is based on the Minimum, =
Maximum, and Value properties of the ProgressBar. Connecting to the =
server is only one part of the equation. Once you have the array of =
pending changes, you can pass the PendingChange array instance and any =
check-in comments to the CheckIn method to perform the actual check-in =
operation. As noted, before the add-in can do any work, it needs to =
connect to a valid Team Foundation Server. The ProgressBar control =
actually has two default templates for the two orientations.
The core set of APIs the add-in uses to interact with Team Foundation =
Server are contained in three assemblies installed as part of a Team =
Explorer installation. A Trigger element for the IsMouseOver property is =
often included so the control reacts when the mouse passes over the =
control.
The Visual TreeLet's begin by looking at a template for a fairly simple =
but non-trivial control: the CheckBox.
In a future column, I'll enhance this form to support work items and =
check-in notes.
If the credentials are invalid, Team Explorer displays a dialog asking =
for a valid user name and password.
This template defines different thumb shapes when tick marks are =
displayed on just one side of the Slider, and the template contains many =
gradient brushes used in coloring this thumb.
You can see this in the way the services have been factored on the =
server.
NET files and the source code of dynamically generated classes used to =
serve page responses. If you're thinking about programming a custom =
control that will work like an existing Windows Presentation Foundation =
control but with a different look, stop now!
Currently, Microsoft does not provide an API to create a Team Project, =
so this is something you must do manually before attempting to put =
documents under version control.

You'll find the relevant methods you need to do your work as members of =
the Workspace class. You need to be careful with using other versions of =
GetPendingChanges.
Last month, I began my look at this process.
To do any work with Team Foundation Server, you must first acquire an =
instance of the root object, TeamFoundationServer. In order to move =
documents in and out of the server, the client machine needs some =
configuration also.
