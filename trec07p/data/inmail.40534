 Kent  is the south easternmost county in England. Its county town is Maidstone
and its only city is Canterbury, which is the seat of the Archbishop of
Canterbury. Kent has land borders with East Sussex, Surrey and Greater London,
and a defined boundary with Essex in the middle of the Thames estuary. The
ceremonial county of Kent includes the unitary authority of Medway, and the
administrative county of Kent. Kent also has a nominal border with France
halfway along the Channel Tunnel.

Situated between the capital and the continent, Kent is a primary trade route
and has been in the front line of a number of conflicts, including the Battle of
Britain in World War II. Through much of the past 800 years, the county s ports
had been relied upon to provide ships during times of war, especially the Cinque
Ports in the 12th 14th centuries and Chatham Dockyard in the 16th 20th
centuries.

Kent is known as the Garden of England due to its agricultural influence,
extensive orchards and hop gardens. Cement, papermaking and aircraft
construction have also been major industries in North West Kent, although these
are now in decline. Tourism and service industries have grown throughout the
county in recent years.

History


The area has been occupied since the Lower Palaeolithic as finds from the
quarries at Swanscombe attest. During the Neolithic the Medway megaliths were
built and there is a rich sequence of Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman occupation
indicated by finds and features such as the Ringlemere gold cup and the Roman
villas of the Darent valley. ref name  prehistoric   /ref 

The modern name of Kent is derived from the Brythonic word Cantus meaning a rim
or border, being applied as a name to the eastern part of the current county
area, and meaning border land or coastal district. Julius Caesar described it as
Cantium, home of the Cantiaci in 51 BC. ref name  name   /ref 

The extreme west of the modern county was occupied by other Iron Age tribes  the
Regnenses and possibly another ethnic group occupying The Weald. East Kent
became one of the kingdoms of the Jutes during the fifth century AD  see Kingdom
of Kent  ref name  kingdom   /ref  and the area was later known as Cantia from
about 730 and Cent in 835. The early Mediaeval inhabitants of the county were
known as the Cantwara or Kent people, whose capital was Canterbury. ref
name  history   /ref 

Canterbury is the religious centre of the Anglican faith, and see of St
Augustine of Canterbury. Augustine is traditionally credited with bringing
Christianity to the county and thus to England in 597. ref
name  Augustine   /ref  Rochester is another of Kent s religious centres, the
see being founded in 604. ref name  RP2000Y    /ref 

Following the invasion of Britain by William of Normandy the people of Kent
adopted the motto [[Invicta  motto  Invicta]] meaning undefeated and claiming
that they had frightened the Normans out of the county. Although, in reality the
Normans were only in Kent en route to London. Once London was reached, the
Normans ignored most of East Kent due to attacks by peasants. As a result, Kent
became a semi autonomous County Palatine under William s half brother Odo of
Bayeux, with the special powers otherwise reserved for counties bordering Wales
and Scotland. ref name  odo    /ref 

During the medieval and early modern period, Kent produced several of England s
most notable rebellions. Kent provided the main force, led by Wat Tyler, for the
Peasants  Revolt of 1381, ref name  revolt   /ref  as well as producing Jack
Cade s Kent rebellion of 1450, and Wyatt s Rebellion of 1553 against Mary I. ref
name  wyatt   /ref 

Canterbury became a great pilgrimage site following the martyrdom of Thomas
Becket, ref name  pilgrim   /ref  who was eventually canonised in 1246. ref
name barnard  /ref  Canterbury s religious role also gave rise to Chaucer s
Canterbury Tales, a key development in the rise of the written English language
and ostensibly set in the countryside of Kent. Rochester had its own martyr,
William of Perth, and in 1256 Lawrence, Bishop of Rochester travelled to Rome to
obtain Williams canonisation. ref name barnard/ 

The Royal Navy first used the River Medway in 1547 when a storehouse was rented
on  Jyllingham Water . By the reign of Elizabeth I  1558 1603  a small dockyard
had been established at Chatham. By 1618, storehouses, a ropewalk, a drydock and
houses for officials had been built downstream from Chatham. ref

/Argentina/, officially the /Argentine Republic/ /Spanish/ /Rep//blica
Ar

gentina/, , Naci//n Argentina /Argentine Nation/ for many legal purposes/, is
a South Amer

ican country, second in size in the continent to Brazil and eighth
in the world. Argentina

 occupies a continental surface area of
2,766,890/nbsp/km// /1,078,000/nbsp/sq/nbsp/mi/ be

tween the Andes mountain range
in the west and the southern Atlantic Ocean in the east and

 south.

It is bordered by Paraguay and Bolivia in the north, Brazil and Uruguay in the
no

rtheast, and Chile in the west and south. The country claims the British
controlled territ

ories of the Falkland Islands // and South Georgia and the
South Sandwich Islands. Under t

he name of Argentine Antarctica, it claims
969,464/nbsp/km// /374,312/nbsp/sq/nbsp/mi/ of 

Antarctica, overlapping other
claims made by Chile and the United Kingdom.

Etymology

/Ar

gentina/ derives from the Latin argentum /silver/. When the first Spanish
conquistadors di

scovered the R//o de la Plata, they named the estuary Mar Dulce
//Sweet Sea/, as in a fres

h water sea/. Indigenous people gave gifts of silver
to the survivors of the shipwrecked e

xpedition, who were led by Juan D//az de
Sol//s. The legend of Sierra del Plata /ndash/ a 

mountain rich in silver /ndash/
reached Spain around 1524, and the name was first seen in 

print on a Venice map
from 1536. The source of the silver was the area where the city of P

otos// was
to be founded in 1546. An expedition that followed the trail of the silver up
t

he Paran// and Pilcomayo rivers finally reached the source only to find it
already claimed

 by explorers who reached it from Lima, the capital of the
Viceroyalty of Peru.

The name 

Argentina was first used extensively in the 1612 book Historia del
descubrimiento, poblaci

//n, y conquista del R//o de la Plata /History of the
discovery, population, and conquest 

of the R//o de la Plata/ by Ruy D//az de
Guzm//n, naming the territory Tierra Argentina /L

History


The first signs of human presenc

e in Argentina are located in the Patagonia
/Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz/, and date from 11,0

00
BC./ref/[http///es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedra_Museo Piedra Museo]//ref/ Around
1/nbsp/AD

, several maize/based civilizations developed in the Andean region
/Santa Mar//a, Huarpes,

 Diaguitas, Sanavirones, among others/. In 1480, the Inca
Empire under the rule of emperor

 Pachacutec launched an offensive and conquered
present/day northwestern Argentina, integr

ating it into a region called
Collasuyu. In the northeastern area, the Guaran// developed 

a culture based on
yuca and sweet potato. The central and southern areas /Pampas and Patag

onia/
were dominated by nomadic cultures, unified in the seventeenth century by the
Mapuch

es.


European explorers arrived in 1516. Spain established a permanent colony on the
site

 of Buenos Aires in 1580/ the Viceroyalty of the R//o de la Plata was
created in 1776. In 

1806 and 1807 the British Empire launched two invasions to

 Kent  is/> the south easternmos<t county in En/>gland. Its county town is<Maidstone
and its only city is Canter/>rbury, which is the seat of the Archbis<op of
Canterb/>ury. Kent has land borders with <East Sussex, Surrey and Greate/>r London,
and a de<fined boundary with />Essex in th< middle of the Thames estuary. The
cerem/>onial co<nty of Kent includes the unitary/>y authority of Medway< and the

halfw/>way along the Cha<nel Tunnel.

Situated /> between the ca<ital and/> the continent, Ke<nt/> is a primary trade route<and/>d has<been in t/>the front line of a number<of conflicts, including/>g the Battle of
<Britain in World War II. Through much/> of t<he past 800 years, the county s po/>rts

Ports in the <12t/>h 14th centuries and Chatham Dockya<d in the 16th 20th/>h
centuries.

Kent is known as< the Garden of England due t/>to its agricultural influence,
extensive<orchards/> and hop gardens. Cement, papermaki<g and aircraft
construction have /> also been major industries in North W<st K/>Kent, although these
are now in decl<ne. Tourism and service indus/>stries have grown throughout the
c<unty in rece/>ent<years.

o/>or border, being applied as a n<me to the eastern part of/>f the current county
area, and mean<ing border la/>nd or coa<tal district. Julius Caesar />described it as
