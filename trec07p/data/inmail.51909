Att:Assistance Needed

I am Major B. Harrison , a senior security officer under charles
Taylor,former Liberian President.Having got great affection and
absolute appreciation for your human and personality,I wish to contact you for
absolute help to safeguard and bank this sum of $16.1m(Sixteen Million One
Hundred Thousand Dollars)into your account for me,preferably we can split the
sum into three bank accounts if your account will not accommodate all the
sum.presently this money is in the security vault in Europe.

Source Of The Funds:

I am a senior security officer in charge of arms and ammunition of
Charles Taylor troops.I and three officers were assigned to purchase arms and
ammunition in france,on getting to Ghana,we heard a news that U.S.A.  
government
had given an ultimatum for our president,Charles Taylor to leave the country
for a political asylum with immediate effect.
Perhaps,we saw this as a golden opportunities to divert the funds  
$48.4 for our
personal use and for the people of Liberia,then the funds were shared among us
$16.1m each.

The arrangement of sharing this money is as a result of helping
ourselves and Liberian people since our president has been sent out by U.S
government on political asylum in Nigeria. just time back He was arrested by
the nigeira Government and handed over to the UN to face war crimes in the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the  Hague Netherlands.

In view of this i now decided this is the right time to pull the funds as the
future of my family and Liberians depends on this fund and  i will be very
grateful if you can assist me to bank this fund.
Note:I don't want the leadership of president Charles Taylor to have
idea of where i am and the fund.When this fund is cleared and banked in your
nominated account,i will meet with you to establish an investment with your
assistance.

I am presently on political assylum in London England, and my
present status does not allow me to make a trip out of my present jurisdiction
hence my decision to contact you for help For your reward and expected sevices
40% will be for you,while 60% will be for my family and the people of Liberia
investment.
