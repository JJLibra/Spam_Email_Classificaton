Dear,

I am optimistic to request for your consent in
a mutual international business relationship
between you and i. My name is Paul Patterson,
I got your contact from the web while searching for investment
opportunity. I am a civil servant who realized $140.5 million Through the sale of our allocated oil quota in OPEC
from commission payouts throught my tenure as the Head of Delegation to the World Bank in West Africa. 

I want you to assist me in investing this fund in real estate and commercial properties or any other profitable venture you are familiar with
since as a civil servant I cannot have such funds and the code of conduct bureau forbids me to 
acquire such amount of money.

Upon your consent to this request i will send my
proposal and we will discuss in details. Thank you for
giving me your time, am hoping for a friendly response.
 
Regards,

Paul Patterson.
