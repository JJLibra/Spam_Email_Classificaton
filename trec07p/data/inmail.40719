And then, on a glistening day, she stepped into my world and became my world. There were just eighteen guests participating in our wedding. Ten of them were my factory worker friends; six of Mia's friends and two were our combined, uniformed best wishers. Yes, the KGB. We had no one to call 'ours' but these few. After a short and simple ceremony, our friends departed us joking and laughing, while the KGB guests bid us farewell staring and glaring. They wanted to see us off to our bedroom door, I am sure. But I was not bothered by anything any more. I had found Mia. She was full of life. She pervaded me with it.

Our intention is to offer to only those interested. If not the mechanizim is in place for you to decide.
