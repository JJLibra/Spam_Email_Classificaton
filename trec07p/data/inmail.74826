ERMX Continues To Expand As Stock Climbs Up 16.6%!

EntreMetrix Inc. (ERMX)
$0.21 UP 16.6%

ERMX announced further expansion with K-9 Genetics. Healthy and Premium
dog foods grossed $3.6 Billion in 2006, up from $1.9 billion in previous
years. Read up on ERMX over the holiday, we think you will see even more
fireworks on Thursday morning!

It couldn't have been my accent, which is flawless. A mad world, my
masters. At last I found a bus that seemed to be going to "Rockavirr",
as the driver said.
You heard it here first. Just another tragic example of American
cultural imperialism.

I admit that it's a sobering thought that this site may be influencing
Big Media. A mad world, my masters.

I promise not to use it as a force for good. Also in squid news, the
various squid classifications mentioned here earlier - Porchiteuthis,
Arborteuthis - have inspired a couple of not-yet-discovered species of
giant squid. Further developments will be reported as they occur, if not
before.

I guess they thought we must eat that as well, and thought "eggy in a
basket" was a quaint and Olde Worlde version.

For example, I came up with a new variety of Very Angry Squid -
Soreteuthis.

The convenience, the price, and the novelty of the thing are what sold
me. One lady tried to bully me onto her bus, which was not going to DC -
she was actually trying to shove my considerable bulk up the bus steps.

The Museum Cats have hunkered down for the duration, and after I put the
pork roast into go in the oven, I'm going to take a nap.

Guess what we had for breakfast this morning?
I promise not to use it as a force for good.
I've never heard of anyone taming a Gray Dire Cat before, but if I do it
and survive, I shall name him Leroy. According to Museum files, Allan
Janus would drink just about anything he could cadge, rum included if it
was on offer; but his favorite tipple seems to have been the local apple
jack.
Above, Jessica Biel as Sophie, Edward Norton as Eisenheim, and Paul
Giamatti as Uhl with a skirmish line of pickelhaubed Viennese peelers.

When we rolled out, I ate my buns, fired up my laptop, and read my email
by hitching on to unsecured wifi as we passed through town, which made
me feel very high-tech and all.

I also bought a bag of pork buns at a carryout on East Broadway - very
nice.

Stud locators are cheap and easy to use. Cat Peake hangs out on a
neighbor's porch on the Historic Circle.
I confess that I don't attempt the elegant flip that V performs, above.
Oh, it's the finest thing! "Eggy in a basket" apparently.
One lady tried to bully me onto her bus, which was not going to DC - she
was actually trying to shove my considerable bulk up the bus steps.

Right - didn't have the opportunity to fight oppression today, though;
will do it tomorrow.
