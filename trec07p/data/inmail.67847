  <p>Opinion of our customers:<br>
    <strong>My order arrived within one week in perfect condition. The pills are phenomenal! I only use half of a pill at a time, and sometimes the effect is still noticeable the next morning! I've even tried a third of a pill once (I didn't split it very well) and I still felt the desired effect. Thanks for good service and a great product! David Harvey, El Monte, CA<br>
