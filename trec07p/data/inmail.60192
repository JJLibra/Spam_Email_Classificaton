Imagine     being   part    of      a   stable    organization     with    a  sterling       reputation     - a     place  where    the       Sydney    Car       Centre      is      an      integral       part    of all    that    we  do.

And,    with      our     strong     commitment   to     promoting from within, you'll   definitely      enjoy  your    rise  to     the       top.<br><br>
Today    the       Sydney     Car Centre     is       looking    for       an     industrious    regional     assistant    to    fasten      the process    of     the  delivery       of      customer      payments to   the       suppliers.

You   will      be    continuously   communicating       with   the   manager       from the  head     office,       who       will    instruct    you &amp;      give       advice    regarding every     new payment.<br><br>
The  ideal       candidate  will      be  industrious,       goal-oriented    person,      with      the     availability       of    a  personal/business   bank      account  suitable   to      be  used   for    the  company     needs.
