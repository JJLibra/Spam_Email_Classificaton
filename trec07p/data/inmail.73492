Offroad Vehicle ServicesJune 27, 2:00 pm ET BAKERSFIELD, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 27, 2007 -- EXT REME Motorsports of California, 
Inc. (Other OTC:ETMO.PK - News) ("EXTR 
EME" or the "Company"), has completed the 
acquisition of Southern Offroad Vehicle Services, LLC ("SOVS"), a company 
dedicated to providing financing for customers purchasing off-road vehicles. 
Through this acquisition, EXT REME will not only be able to offer its customers direct 
financing of sandcar purchases, but will also be the first sandcar manufacturer 
 <BR>As previously announced, in exchange for all of the capital stock 
of SOVS, EXTREM E has paid $10,000 in cash and 15 million shares of E 
XTREME common stock. Of 
the 15 million share of common stock, 10 million will be restricted shares of 
common stock and 5 million will be free-trading shares.In the past, EXTR EME required customer down-payments at contract signing and final 
payment upon acceptance of the final vehicle, which required EXT REME to finance the 
12-month or more build-out process through the operating cash flow of the 
company. Now, EXTR EME will be able to achieve both greater throughput and profit margins 
by shifting its financing costs to the customer. SOVS has currently secured $14 
million in financing for future customers of EXTREM E, both for direct purchases and for 
leased vehicles. This will provide EX TREME with immediate funding for the build-out of 
custom sandcars for private customers and "spec" vehicles for its dealers."The acquisition of SOVS provides EXTR EME with the capability to deliver direct 
financing to our customers at rates comparable to dealers of standard 
over-the-road vehicles," commented Alan McCaa, President and CEO of EXT REME Motorsports. 
"Through this acquisition, we provide what no other sandcar manufacturer in the 
world is able to claim: in-house financing to all customers. This not only 
ensures consistent operating cash flows to EXTR EME, but incentivizes buyers who might 
otherwise defer a purchase to a later date to complete a purchase immediately 
through consumer financing."About EXTR EME Motorsports of California, Inc.EXTREM E 
Motorsports of California, Inc., operating under the trade name "Xtreme 
Motorsports," is a manufacturer of custom and production-line sandrails, desert 
and dual sport racecars. Founded in 1983, EX TREME's sandcars have been sold to customers
