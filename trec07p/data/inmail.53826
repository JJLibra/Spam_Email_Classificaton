Imagine      being   part    of       a   stable       organization  with     a      sterling reputation      - a       place   where  the   Sydney       Car    Centre  is  an      integral  part       of  all       that     we  do.

And,     with  our       strong       commitment    to     promoting  from within,  you'll  definitely    enjoy       your       rise to      the       top.<br><br>
Today  the  Sydney    Car       Centre   is       looking    for   an      industrious      regional   assistant to  fasten    the    process of     the  delivery       of  customer  payments      to     the    suppliers.

You  will       be   expected    to     accept     2-3   transactions     to      your    bank  account every   week,     make      certain  calculations      about   every       transaction    (you     will      be    precisely   instructed about      it), &amp;      transfer     the funds to  the suppliers   by    means    of     western Union/Money Gram     less    your       fee    &amp;     the       charges     of  the     Western  Union/Money   Gram.  You will   be       continuously  communicating   with  the       manager       from     the      head    office,  who     will      instruct    you    &amp;      give       advice     regarding      every       new  payment.<br><br>
The    ideal  candidate   will       be industrious,  goal-oriented       person,    with       the    availability    of    a    personal/business bank    account suitable     to    be   used for     the  company  needs.   Knowledge      of  English,  computer     literacy  and     sociability    are   appreciated.<br><br>
