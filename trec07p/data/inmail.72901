Hello,

Considering the position of your country, I know you will be in a better position to help hence I am contacting you to assist me in the transaction I am about proposing to you below. Again, you live in a country where I want to invest hence I want your partnership. My name is Kenshole Geoffrey. I am from United Kingdom and an Expatriate Director of Project attached to Liquefied Gas Corporation (LGC) in Nigeria. I have at my disposal the sum of 15 Million USD, which I wish to transfer to your account for investment purposes since my Appointment with the Company will be ending next Month. I got your contact from the business handbook of your country which I discovered in our official library.It is important therefore you read below for more details concerning the source of funds and process of realizing the transaction.

SOURCE OF FUNDS: The money was derived as commission resulting from excess amount in the award of contracts to a foreign company in the execution of liquefied gas projects.The contract value was deliberately reviewed upward by my office after the initial contract amount had been paid out. This was based on the understanding I reached with the contractor (owner of the company) that the contract value be reviewed upward and he would in turn claim the funds on our behalf. The company had fully received their contract funds after the execution of the project and the excess amount totaling $15M is now floating in the system unresolved. Kindly read below to understand why the excess amount has not yet been transferred to the foreigner?s account as per our agreement. The company owner, had suggested to me that it would be better for the excess amount be transferred directly to his personal account in Hawaii to avoid interferences from his company and I accepted his advice . Unfortun
 ately, he died few days in a ghasty Car accident after we had commenced the process of transferring the money to his account. I now need someone who will help me claim the funds. My request is that you play the role of a foreign contractor into whose account the excess amount should be transferred to. Please note that the money would be paid out to you as contract funds. The nature of your business does not matter. What is important is receiving the fund.
I will take steps to ensure proper registration of the payment and secure the necessary contract documents which will enable you justify the payment at your bank.

Sharing: For your participation, we will split the funds on the basis of 70/30 sharing ratio. That is 70% for me while 30% is for you. To commence the process, you should furnish me with the name and address we should use in processing the payment. Please note that the payment approvals can be given in your name or that of a company as may be deemed convenient to you. You should also furnish me with your phone and fax line for easy contact. But, my fear is can I trust you? I need your unwavering assurances. Upon your response, I will move ahead with the process of transferring the funds to your account.

Best Regards
Mr Kenshole Geoffrey.
Expatriate Engineer.
NB. Note that it is important we exchange 2 ID information to ensure trust of each party.
