<P>Dear Memo,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently sent you an email  in which I explaine=
d, with proof, the special place Friday the 13th holds in world history and =
what you, Memo, could hope for from this date of extraordinary luck!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I haven't heard back from you.&nbsp; Eve=
n more seriously, <U>I'm worried that you might miss this chance to gain the=
 immense benefits that could be yours. The incredible forces that will be se=
t in motion on Friday, July 13th, 2007</U>, the second and last Friday the 1=
3th of this year, has the power to launch you on an unbelievable lucky strea=
k that will last for 365 days!</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>BELIEVE ME, GREAT LUCK CAN COME IN SWIFT AND DRAMATIC F=
ASHION DURING THIS MAGICAL TIME.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Because, contrary to popular superstition, F=
riday the 13th can (especially for certain individuals) actually be a day of=
 significant good fortune and opportunity.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD width=3D687>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>And I will show you exactly how you can be<BR>one of th=
ose certain very lucky individuals!</B> </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here in front of my eyes, letters from fri=
ends who got my help in discovering the secrets of how to turn bad luck into=
 powerful good luck and positive breakthroughs. Here is an example: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>"I just have to share with you my piec=
e of good luck.&nbsp; A few days ago, after I received your predictions...I =
won $1000!&nbsp; I had never won $1000 before.&nbsp; It was such a blessing =
and an answer to my prayers.&nbsp; Thanks again and God bless you for using =
your gift to help others..."</B> </EM>
<P align=3Dright><B><EM>-&nbsp;A.M.A., VA</EM></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the huge number of people who have written a=
bout how they have profited from the power of this day, I could go on foreve=
r.&nbsp; But the purpose of this letter is not to make you regret what you m=
ight've missed in the past, but to offer you YOUR VERY OWN CHANCE to benefit=
 from the forces set in motion by this "day unlike any other day."</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>THIS IS NOT MERELY IDLE SUPERSTITION!&nbsp;</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Friday the 13th is serious business!=
&nbsp; Whether you believe in superstitions or not, their power to affect in=
numerable aspects of every day life is undeniable.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, baseball, "America's game", is famou=
s for its superstitions.&nbsp; In 1996 John Wetteland, closing pitcher for t=
he New York Yankees, refused to change his cap for the entire regular and po=
st baseball season. He ended up leading the Yankees to their first World Ser=
ies win since 1978, broke an eighteen-year streak of bad luck, and was ultim=
ately voted Most Valuable Player of the championship series.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streets named by numbers often skip the number 13=
, and in high rise buildings, the twelfth floor is almost always followed im=
mediately by the 14th floor.&nbsp; The 13th floor is simply "skipped" over o=
r given a "safer" label.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Science itself has proven the power of superstitions in=
<BR>general and of Friday the 13th in particular...</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Friday the 13th coincides with a measurable=
 economic downturn.&nbsp; On that day people tend to avoid travel, business =
transactions, and contact with the outside world.&nbsp; As a result the rest=
aurant, vacation, and entertainment industries lose billions of dollars.</P>=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there's more to it than just people's fears. =
Scientific studies performed in Britain proved that although fewer people dr=
ive on Friday the 13th, the number of collision-related hospital admissions =
is significantly greater than on normal Fridays.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are people just driving "spooked" on Friday the 1=
3th...so that they're jittery and more prone to foolish mistakes?&nbsp; Does=
 the economy take a dip because nervous people simply stay home?&nbsp; Do su=
perstitious practices just enhance a baseball player's sense of security and=
 confidence and help him succeed?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibly, but I think it's something more than th=
at, don't you?</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>I want to tell you a secret: Friday the 13th<BR></B><B>=
is actually an incredible force for good luck and prosperity</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend of the number 13 itself goes back to 6=
00 B.C. and the philosophy of Pythagoras, who believed that 13 did not mean =
a cutoff, but rather a chance for evolution and change.&nbsp; It did not poi=
nt to warnings of endings but rather to new beginnings.&nbsp; Thus, it was a=
 number to be favored and a favorable date on which to enter this world.</P>=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday the 13th was also a holy day in the Church=
. A true miracle occurred at St. Paul's Cathedral, in London, on Friday the =
13th in December, 1940.&nbsp; The lives of hundreds of people were saved whe=
n the famous church remained untouched during one of the worst air raids in =
the history of World War II.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical day has even made baseball history! =
On Friday, July 13th, 1984, Pete Rose hit a double off Jerry Koosman in Olym=
pic Stadium to become only the second player to reach the 4,000-hit level, a=
fter Ty Cobb.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Regardless of Friday the 13th's history, there=
 is an inexplicable sense that luck can be dramatically altered on this date=
 -- a feeling so strong that, as studies have shown, it affects the fortunes=
 of millions of people throughout the world.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, <U>unlike you</U>, Memo, these people do not=
 know <U>how to take the power of Friday the 13th and turn it into a force f=
or incredible good luck and prosperity</U>!&nbsp; That is why I don't want y=
ou to miss...</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>YOUR CHANCE FOR HAPPINESS!<BR></B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>And believe me, because the event in July will=
 be <U>the last Friday the 13th to happen this year</U>, you must not UNDER =
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES miss this tremendously lucky opportunity while there's sti=
ll time!</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A SECRET, MEMO...</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know that most people wait for beneficial =
events to come to them?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a mistake!&nbsp; Not only will they have =
to wait a very long time before any beneficial event occurs, but on top of t=
hat, there is no evidence to show that, if a person is not ready to receive =
them, these happy events will ever come to pass!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only truly successful method I know of for ta=
king advantage of beneficial events is to be one step ahead of them...to act=
ually encourage wonderful things to happen to you.&nbsp; This is the way&nbs=
p;- the only way&nbsp;- you stand any chance of winning something.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>If, on the other hand, you choose (as I would)=
 to be one step ahead of these beneficial events, I can help you.</B>&nbsp; =
I can reveal to you, among other things, how to obtain from this day of bles=
sings, and the other 365 days following it, benefits you will treasure for t=
he rest of your life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can be one of the few, lucky individuals who&=
nbsp;gains from this day.&nbsp; You'll be free and empowered to buy lottery =
tickets, change jobs, purchase homes, travel to gambling casinos and engage =
in any and every other conceivable activity where fate might have an opportu=
nity to give you a happy pat on the shoulder.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>NO ONE WILL BE AS PREPARED FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS YOU.</B>=
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?&nbsp; <U>Because unlike most people who only=
 hope for good luck, your luck is already waiting for you to draw it in.</U>=
 Fortunately too, I stand ready to assist you in ATTRACTING as much luck and=
 good fortune as possible, helping you to capitalize on Friday, July 13th's =
own POSITIVE energy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How?&nbsp; By providing you with a very special T=
alisman that will help you to function as a virtual "psychic magnet" so that=
 you can pull in all the money, romance, power and good fortune that my sens=
es tell me will soon be within your reach.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>HERE IS WHAT YOU MUST DO TO DRAW MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROM<B=
R></B><B>THIS DAY BLESSED BY THE GODS!</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is absolutely vital that you wea=
r, for the 365 days after you receive it, a very specially energized talisma=
n...</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>THE "MEDALLION OF HOPE"</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crafted in genuine 24K gold vermeil, for purity a=
nd protection, I had the "<B>Medallion of Hope</B>" made to reflect the desi=
gn of an ancient talisman that has brought me incalculable success and happi=
ness over the years.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want you to have this medallion, so you too can=
 uncover its secrets and invaluable benefits.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prominently featuring three mystical symbols, the=
 "<B>Medallion of Hope</B>" has the power to attract and magnify your good l=
uck following this unique Friday the 13th (the last of two such occurrences =
this year).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mandala is believed to concentrate the positi=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, the symbols I've already told you=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your precious vermeil "<B>Medallion of Hope</B>" =

<P align=3Dcenter><B>An incredible value, exclusively for you</B>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tremendous power of its unique, ancient =

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why it is a pleasure for me to offer you =
the "<B>Medallion of Hope</B>" at a very special price of $6.95 to cover shi=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other explanation, to my knowledge, f=
