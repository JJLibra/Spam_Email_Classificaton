The  House Finch   Carpodacus mexicanus  is a medium sized finch. .  ]] Adults
have a long brown tail and are a brown or dull brown color across the back with
some shading into deep grey on the wing feathers. Breast and belly feathers may
be streaked. In most cases, adult males have a reddish color to their heads,
necks and shoulders. This color sometimes extends to the stomach and down the
back, between the wings. The male coloration varies in intensity with the
seasons and is derived from the berries and fruits in its diet. As a result, the
colors range from pale, straw yellow, to bright orange, to deep, intense red.
Adult females have brown upperparts and streaked underparts.

These birds are mainly permanent residents  some eastern birds migrate south.
Their breeding habitat is urban and semi open areas from southern Canada to
Mexico.

House Finches forage on the ground or in vegetation. They primarily eat grains,
seeds and berries, being voracious consumers of weed seeds such as nettle and
dandelion  included are incidental small insects, such as aphids and plant lice.
They are frequent visitors to feeders throughout the year, particularly if
stocked with sunflower seeds or Nyjer thistle seed, and will congregate at
hanging Nyjer sock feeders. They are considered a pest in fruit orchards.

Nests are made in cavities, including openings in buildings, and also on various
kinds of vegetation, sometimes nests abandoned by other birds will be used.
Nests may be re used for subsequent broods or in following years. The nest is
built by the female, sometimes in as little as two days. It is well made of
twigs and debris, forming a cup shape, usually 1.5m to 2m above the ground.

Eggs are laid from February through August, two or more broods per year with 2
to 6 eggs per brood. The eggs are a pale, bluish green with few black spots and
a smooth, somewhat glossy surface. The female incubates the eggs for 12 to 14
days and the young leave the nest about 11 to 19 days after hatching. Dandelion
seeds are among the preferred seeds fed to the young.

During courtship, the male may present the female with choice bits of food and,
if she imitates the posture of a hungry chick, he may actually feed her. The
male may also feed the female during the breeding and incubation period.

House Finches are one of the few birds that are aggressive enough to keep House
Sparrows out of their birdhouse and evict them.

Originally only a resident of Mexico and the southwestern United States, they
were introduced to eastern North America in the 1940s. The birds were being sold
illegally in New York while marketed as the  Hollywood Finch.  Many vendors and
owners released the birds into the wild in order to avoid prosecution. The
released birds spread rapidly and, in some unforested areas, have displaced the
native Purple Finch. In 1870, they were introduced into Hawaii.

Their song is a rapid, cheery warble or a variety of chirps. A sample of their
song can be heard at the USGS site here[http   www.mbr 
pwrc.usgs.gov Infocenter Song h5190so.mp3].
