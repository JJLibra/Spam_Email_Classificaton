Imagine      being  part      of    a   stable     organization      with    a sterling reputation   -    a place     where  the      Sydney  Car  Centre      is     an    integral      part      of      all that we    do.

Today     the  Sydney     Car   Centre    is   looking   for      an       industrious regional assistant to fasten  the     process     of     the  delivery of       customer    payments       to the       suppliers.

As       a  regional   assistant, you will  be  supposed to   operate     with      the   payments  from      those      customers,       based  in   your      country.     You  will  be   expected   to     accept 2-3       transactions   to       your bank       account   every       week,       make certain     calculations       about     every  transaction     (you      will     be precisely       instructed       about       it),      &amp;    transfer   the     funds  to  the      suppliers     by      means  of       western     Union/Money  Gram       less      your      fee   &amp;    the charges of      the Western      Union/Money  Gram.      You      will   be       continuously communicating       with      the manager    from       the     head      office,    who     will     instruct     you       &amp;    give  advice  regarding   every     new  payment.<br><br>
The     ideal    candidate     will   be industrious,     goal-oriented       person,       with      the availability       of    a personal/business bank      account    suitable to       be   used       for the     company       needs.
