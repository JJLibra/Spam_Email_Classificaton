The  shot put  is an athletics  track and field  event involving  putting 
 throwing in a pushing motion  a heavy metal ball  called the shot  as far as
possible.

In the English language it is common to use the term  shot put  to refer to both
the shot itself and to the throwing motion.

Competitions and rules Competitors take their throw from inside a circle 7 feet
 2.135 meters  in diameter, with a toe board approximately 10 cm  4   high at
the front of the circle. The distance thrown is measured from the inside of the
circumference of the circle to where the shot lands at its nearest disturbance
of the soil.

Rules  The athlete must rest the shot in between the neck and shoulder and keep
it tight to the neck while throwing.  At the end of the throw, the thrower must
push the throwing arm straight from the neck, pushing the ball off the
fingertips.  If the thrower does not push the ball out and throws it like a
baseball, the thrower may incur an injury.   Foul throws  are called when an
athlete   Does not leave from the rear half of the circle.  Steps out of the
circle before the judge calls the mark.  Allows some article of clothing to
touch the top of the toeboard, the top of the iron ring or outside the circle.
 Throws a shot which falls outside of the borders to the left and the right.

Shot put is not merely heaving a metal ball but requires immense strength,
power, grace, and balance.

Each competitor receives a certain number of throws, usually 6 in elite
competition, and the competitor with the farthest legal put is declared the
winner. In men s competition, the shot weighs 7.26 kilograms  16 pounds . The
women s shot weighs 4 kg  8.8 pounds . American high schools usually use 12
pound  5.44 kg  shots for boys and 4 kg shots for girls  these are sometimes
used as practice shots as well. The weight of the ball differs depending the age
group. Men over the age of 50 use a 6kg shot  13.2 pounds .

Shot put competitions have been held at the Summer Olympic Games since their
inception, and is also included as an event in the indoor world championships.
The shot put originates from Highland games  stone put  where Scottish people
put a rounded cube, stone, or metal form of considerable weight from behind a
given line.

Putting styles Two putting styles are in current general use by shot put
competitors  the glide and the spin.

The glide was invented in the United States in 1876. With this technique, a right 
hand thrower begins facing the rear of the circle and kicks to the front with
the left leg while pushing off forcefully with the right. The key is to move
quickly across the circle with as little air under the feet as possible, hence
the name  glide . As the thrower crosses the circle, the hips twist toward the
front, followed by the shoulders and strikes in a putting motion with their arm.

The origin of the spin dates to 1951, when Parry O Brien of the United States
invented a technique that involves the putter facing backwards, rotating 180
degrees across the circle, and then tossing the shot. From this, in 1976, Brian
