Tinariwen's new album, Aman Iman: Water is Life is very, very edgy, to =
say the least. He's got a great universal appeal, and his blend of Latin =
music, ska, African music and rock holds a cult-like appeal with =
millions of music fans around the world.
If You Like Bob Marley.
Apparently, a regular part of the show involves the remaining American =
Idol contestants performing a song in a music video.
I was, in fact, watching American Idol.
Gypsy punk bands like Gogol Bordello and techno-gypsy bands like Balkan =
Beat Box are causing riotous reactions among hipsters throughout the US =
and Europe. So, any world music fans out there planning on attending =
Bonnaroo?
Putumayo World Music is no slouch, and they've stayed on top of this =
trend by putting out the fantastic Gypsy Groove album to feed the need. =
