Dear customer.This is the letter from the CanadianPharmacy. We prove that "generic" doesn't necessarily mean "expensive". If you shop for drugs online, please, read this to the end.Shopping for medications on the Web is really convenient but you should also pay a lot of attention to the quality and the price of product offered. At CanadianPharmacy you will always be able to find drugs of 100% generic quality. CanadianPharmacy we don't save on our clients.CanadianPharmacy no one is able to match our prices for generic medications neither in Canada nor in the USA.Sincerely yours,Rosalyn Hurley
