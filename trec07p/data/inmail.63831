• Asia became the center for industrial manufacturing several years ago and is now making inroads into high technology, cutting-edge manufacturing for things like chips, according to George Scalise, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, which keeps tabs and sends out alarms on America's decline. (I came up with this gloomy prognosis after speaking with Scalise. Because of the nature of his job, he can have that effect on people.)

WE HAVE RECEIVED a picture of a 3DMark score from a system running the late and upcoming ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT card. This board was planned to cost around $80, but in reality, you can expect prices to be way lower.  Even a quick spin may turn up, as it did on a recent once-over of the Codex Atlanticus, the spring-propelled vehicle thought to be a precursor to Mars rovers. And the high-resolution images are arguably as close as one will get to the real thing unless you're Bill Gates.  Well we know this was not created by a Republican conservative like me.

Mondial Energy, meanwhile, has also promoted solar thermal water heaters in Canada. These trap heat from the sun and use it to heat water. The solar water heaters may not generate all of the energy required to heat the water, but can take care of a substantial percentage. Mondial has put solar thermal systems in laundromats and retirement homes, and is exploring installing some in hotels in the U.S., said Mondial President Alex Winch.
