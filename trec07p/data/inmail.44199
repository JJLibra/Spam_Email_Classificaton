 Jai Alai    in English and in Basque  means  Merry Festival  in the Basque
language. The term is used to denote a fronton  or open walled arena  used to
play a variety of Pelota called Cesta Punta, and, more broadly, to the game
itself. The ball is placed into play and volleyed by players wearing a wicker
cesta basket with a glove approximately 63 to 70 cm long. The game is
characterized by the fast pace of play, the Basque Government promotes it as
 the fastest game on Earth , a 125g 140g ball covered with goat skin can travel
up to 302 km h  Jos   Ram  n Areitio at the Newport Jai Alai, Rhode Island, USA
on 3 August 1979 ref name  Guinness    ref name  GuinnessFastest  Libro de los
r  cords Guinness, page 258. It lists it as the faster speed recorded in a ball
game, comparing to 273 km h of golf.  ref  


The basket glove  xistera in Basque, cesta punta in Spanish  was introduced by
Gantchiqui Dithurbide from Saint P  e, France in 1860, ref name  Guinness  Libro
de los r  cords Guinness, page 320, 1986 Spanish edition, Ediciones Maeva, ISBN
84 86478 00 6  ref  and its long version by Melchior Curuchage, from Buenos
Aires Argentina in 1888. ref name  Guinness   

Rules and play The court  or cancha  for Jai Alai consists of 3 walls  front,
back, and left , and the floor between them in play. If the ball touches the
floor outside these walls, it is considered out of bounds. Similarly, there is
also a border on the lower 3ft of the front wall that is also out of bounds. The
ceiling on the court is usually very high, so the ball has a more predictable
path. The court is divided by 14 parallel lines going horizontally across the
court, with line 1 closest to the front wall and line 14 the back wall. When
serving, the server must bounce the ball behind the serving line, then with the
cesta  basket  hurl it towards the front wall so it bounces between lines 4 and
7 off the front wall, the ball is then in play.

The [goal] in Jai Alai is to score 7 or 9 points, to win the game. Points are
scored by the other team dropping, missing, holding, or sending the ball out of
bounds. The game is played in a round robin format, rotating teams every point,
where the team to score a point stays on the court and the opposing team rotates
off the court to the end of the list of opponents. Points usually double after
the first round of play.

The players frequently attempt a  chula  shot, where the ball is played off the
front wall very high, then reaches the bottom of the back wall by the end of its
arc. The bounce off the bottom of the back wall can be very low, and the ball is
very difficult to return in this situation.

In the United States, jai alai enjoyed some popularity as a gambling alternative
to horse racing, greyhound racing and harness racing and remains popular in
Florida, where the game is used as a basis for parimutuel gambling at six
frontons throughout the State  Dania Beach, Miami, Ocala, Fort Pierce, Orlando,
and Hamilton County. The first jai alai fronton in the United States was located
at the site of Hialeah Race Course near Miami  1924 . The fronton was relocated
to its present site in Miami near Miami International Airport. Year round jai 
alai operations include Miami Jai Alai  the biggest in the world with a record
audience of 15,502 people in 27 December 1975 ref name  Guinness    , Dania Jai 
Alai and Hamilton Jai Alai in North Florida. Seasonal facilities are  Fort
Pierce Jai Alai, Ocala Jai Alai and Orlando Seminole Jai Alai. Inactive jai alai
permits are located  Tampa, Daytona Beach, West Palm Beach, and Quincy. One
Florida fronton was converted from jai alai to Greyhound Racing in Melbourne.

By contrast, jai alai s popularity in the north eastern and western United
States waned as other gambling options became available. Frontons in the
Connecticut towns of Hartford and Milford permanently closed, while the fronton
in Bridgeport was converted to a Greyhound race track. A fronton in Newport,
Rhode Island has been converted to a general gaming facility.

Jai alai enjoyed a brief and popular stint in Las Vegas, Nevada with the opening
of a fronton at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino  however, by the early 1980s the
fronton was losing money and was closed by MGM Grand owner Kirk Kerkorian. The
MGM Grand in Reno also showcased jai alai for a very short period  1978 1980 .

In an effort to prevent the closure of frontons in Florida, the Florida State
Legislature passed HB 1059, a bill that changed the rules regarding the
operation and wagering of poker in a Pari Mutuel facility such as a jai alai
fronton and a greyhound and horseracing track. The bill became law on August 6,
2003.

The International Jai Alai Player Association UAW Local 8868 is the recognized
bargaining agent for jai alai players in most Florida frontons. The union had
also represented jai alai players and fronton employees in Connecticut until its
three frontons perma</STYLE>
