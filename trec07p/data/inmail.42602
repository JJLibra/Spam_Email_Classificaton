    Secret Window  is a 2004 thriller starring Johnny Depp and John Turturro. It
was written and directed by David Koepp, based on the novella Secret Window,
Secret Garden by Stephen King. The story appeared in King s collection [[Four
Past Midnight]]. The film s studio is Columbia Pictures along with Sony
Pictures.

Plot


Johnny Depp plays successful writer  Mort Rainey , who is suffering from
writer s block and has retreated to an isolated lakeside cabin in the face of a
divorce from his wife, Amy  Maria Bello . The source of the divorce is Mort
having made the unfortunate discovery of his wife cheating on him with Ted
Milner  Timothy Hutton , now her boyfriend. Living alone in the woods, Mort is
confronted one day by the mysterious  John Shooter   John Turturro  who accuses
him of plagiarism  they have both written almost identical stories, Mort s
 Secret Window  and Shooter s  Sowing Season. 

The movie follows Mort s struggles to prove conclusively to Shooter and to
himself that he has not plagiarized the story. As the story progresses, Shooter
murders a private investigator  Charles S. Dutton  who Mort had hired to
investigate Shooter, and a local man who was the only person to see them
together. He also burns down the house of Mort s soon to be ex wife as well as
murdering his dog Chico. Ted is convinced that Mort is the culprit responsible
for the burning.

Mort eventually locates the magazine that proves he published  Secret Window 
before Shooter wrote  Sowing Season.  But when Mort gets the magazine, he finds
that the story has been cut out. Mort s inner voice tells him that since the
magazine was sent to him in a sealed UPS package, Shooter could not have
tampered with it. Prompting from his own conscience leads Mort to the
realization that Shooter is not real, only a figment of Mort s imagination
brought so vividly to life through undetected dissociative identity disorder to
personify the dark side of Mort s personality and to commit acts that Mort
himself feels he could not commit  murder, arson . During this revelation, his
concerned ex wife drives up to his cabin, and at that instant he changes his
persona from the well meaning Mort to the murderous Shooter. He then kills his
ex wife and her lover, Ted, with a shovel and buries them in a garden where he
later plants a crop of corn. Afterwards Mort changes profoundly, his writer s
block finally over and his passion for life returned. The movie, however, ends
on a rather sinister note. The local sheriff informs Mort that he knows what he
did and as soon as they find the bodies, he ll go to prison. Mort dismisses the
statement nonchalantly, and replies that  the ending is the most important part
of the story. This one is perfect.  It is then revealed to us that by growing
and consuming corn from the garden where his ex wife and her lover are buried,
Mort is slowly destroying all the evidence needed to incriminate him bit by bit.

It should be noted that this ending is almost the exact opposite of the
novella s ending. In the original story, Rainey s wife discovers Mort s madness,
and Mort is killed, not his ex wife and her fiance. The story, which up to this
point has been a totally non supernatural tale, takes on a slightly more spooky
tone, as it is revealed in a short postscript that Mort s ex wife has received a
letter from Shooter, telling her that he is returning to Mississippi to write a
new novel. This letter is sent to her, after Mort has been killed, suggesting
that Shooter has taken on a life of his own.

Differences from the novella

 In the novella, Mort Rainey has a cat named Bump, who is killed by Shooter. He
never had a dog.  The confrontation he has with Ted on the street never
occurred.  In the novella, the magazine containing Mort s story is burned along
with Amy s house. In the movie, the house is burnt, along with the magazines,
however, Mort then has his publicist send him the other copies of the magazine.
 In the novella, Mort is shot and killed seconds before he murders Amy. However,
at the end of the movie, he kills both Ted and Amy and buries them in his
garden.
  In the novella, it is revealed the name  John Shooter , is a combination of
  names. John was the name of an old classmate he stole a story from and got
  away with. Shooter comes from the name of the Tennessee town in which Ted grew
  up   Shooter s Knob  Shooter s Bay in the film . Ted s Southern accent is the
  subconcious reason Shooter s Mississippi drawl so irritates Mort.  In the
  novella, Mort s story is called  Sowing Season , and Shooter s is  Secret
  Window, Secret Garden . In the film, it is reversed. It is unknown why the
  change was made.  The novella takes place near the fictional King setting of
  Derry, Maine. The movie shifts the setting to</STYLE>

<STYLE>A /parish/ is a type of administrative subdivision. It is used by some Christianchurches, 

usually liturgical churches, and also by the civil government in a
number of countries /se

e [[civil parish]]/. The term Parish derives from Anglo/
Fr. parosse /1075/, later paroche

 /1292/, both forms stem from O.Fr. paroisse,
which itself originates from Latin parochia 

/diocese/, which on its part is from
the Greek word //////////////// for /district/ or /di

ocese/.

Ecclesiastical parishes A parish is a territorial subdivision of a diocese,
eparc

hy or bishopric, within the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion,
the Eastern Ort

hodox Church, the Church of Sweden, and of some other churches.
The word /parish/ is also 

used more generally to refer to the collection of
people who attend a particular church. I

n this usage, a parish minister is one
who serves a congregation.

Roman Catholic Church



/Main article/ [[Parish /Catholic Church/]]

In the Catholic Church, each parish has one /

parish [[priest]]/ /as he is
usually called in England, Ireland and Australia, among other

 places/ or
/pastor/ /as he is called in the United States, among other places/, who has
r

esponsibility and canonical authority over the parish /the Latin for this post
is parochus

/.

A parish priest may have one or more fellow priests assisting him. In Catholic
usage t

his priest is technically a /parochial vicar/, but is commonly called an
/associate pastor

/ or /assistant pastor/ /or just /associate/ or /assistant//, a
curates, or vicars / commo

n as they are, these terms are inaccurate and many
dioceses have recently begun using the 

canonical term /parochial vicar/ even in
general parish communications /bulletins and the 

like/.

Each parish normally has a central church, called the parish church, where
religio

us services take place. Some larger parishes or parishes that have been
combined under one

 pastor may have two or more such churches, or the parish may
be responsible for chapels /

sometimes called /chapels of ease// located at some
distance from the parish church for th

e convenience of distant parishioners.

With the decline in the numbers of people seeking 

ordination, in some countries
parishes are now being merged together or are all sharing th

e services of one
priest in a phenomenon known in the United States as clustering.

In the

 Catholic Church there also exists a special type of ecclesiastical parish
called a nation

al parish, which is not territorial in nature. These are usually
created to serve the need

s of all of the members of a particular language group,
particularly of an immigrant commu

nity, in a large area/ its members are not
defined by where they live, but by their countr

y of origin or native language.

Other variations are also possible. In some Catholic juri

sdictions created for
the armed forces, for instance, the entire diocese or archdiocese is

 treated as
a single parish/ all of the Catholics in the military of the United States and


all of their Catholic dependents, for instance, form the Archdiocese of the
Military Serv

ices, USA, a diocese defined not by territory but by another
quality /in this case, relati

onship to the military/ / this archdiocese has its
own archbishop, and all records and oth

er matters are handled in a central
office rather than by individual priests assigned to m

ilitary post chapels or
chaplains of units in the field.

Church of England Many Church of

 England parishes that existed at the beginning
of the 19th century, owe their existence t

o the establishment of estate churches
by Anglo/Saxon or Norman landowners./ref/NJG Pounds

, A History of the English
Parish, /CUP, 2000///ref/ The parish as a territorial unit surv

ived the
reformation largely untouched. Consequently, the 19th century parish boundary
oft

en corresponds to that of an Anglo/Saxon estate.

In the Church of England, part of the An

glican Communion, the legal right to
appoint or recommend a parish priest is called an adv

owson, and its possessor is
known as a patron. The patron can be an individual, the Crown,

 a bishop, a
college, a charity, or a religious body. Appointment as a parish priest entai

ls
the enjoyment of a benefice. Appointment of patrons is now governed by the
Patronage /B

enefices/ Rules 1987. In mediaeval times and earlier, when the
church was politically and 

economically powerful, such a right could have great
importance. An example can be seen in

 the article on Grendon, Northamptonshire.
It was frequently used to promote particular re

ligious views. For example Robert
Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick presented many puritan clergy.

 In the 19th century
Charles Simeon established a trust to purchase advowsons and install 

evangelical

Plot


Johnny Depp plays successf/>ful w<iter  Mort Rainey , who is sufferi/>ing from
writer s block and has retreat<ed /> to<an isolated lakeside cabin in the f/>ace of a
divorce from his <wife, Amy  Maria Bello . The />source of the divorce is Mort
having mad<e the unfortuna/>te discovery of his wife cheating on him< with Ted
Mi/>ilner  T<mo/>othy Hutton , now her boyfrie<d. Living al/>one in the woods,< Mort is
c/>onfronted one <ay by the /> my<terious  John Sh/>ooter   John Turturro  who accuses
hi<m of plagiarism  they have /> both written a<most identic/>al stories, Mort s
 Secre<t Window  and Shooter/> s  Sowing Season. 

The <movie follows Mort s struggles />to prove conclusively to Shooter< and to
himself that he has />no< plagiarized the story. As the s/>story progresses, Shoo<er
murders a private investigator  Ch/>harles S. Dutton <who Mort had hired to
in/>vesti<gate Shooter, and/> a local man who was the only pe<rson to see them
together/>r. He also burns down the house of M<rt s/> soon to be ex wife as well as
murderin<g his dog Chico. Ted is convinced t/>hat Mort is the culprit res<ponsible/>e
for<the /> burni<g.

Mort eventually locates th/>e maga<zine that prov/>es <e published  Secret/>t Window 
bef<re Shooter wr/>rote  Sowing Season.  But when Mo<rt gets the magazine, he finds
tha/>at the story has been cut out. M<rt s inn/>ner voic< tells him that /> since the
magazine was sent to hi<m in a sealed UPS package, Shooter/> could not have
tampered with it<. Prompting from his own conscience lead/>s Mo<t to the
realizatio/>n that Shooter is not real,< only a figment of />Mort s imagination
brought so vividl<y to life throug/>h unde<tected disso/>ciative identity disorder <to
personify the dark si/>ide of Mort s persona<ity and to commit act/>ts that Mort
himse<f feels he could not co/>ommit  murder, arson . Du<ring/> this rev<l/>lation, his
concer<ed ex w/>w<fe drives up to his cabi/>n, and at <that insta/>nt he changes his
persona <rom the well meaning Mort to the/>e mu<derous Shooter. He then kills his/>s
ex wife and <er lover, Te/>ed, with a shovel and burie<s them in a garden />where h<e
later plants a crop of corn. Afterwa/>r<s Mo/>ort changes profoundly, his wri<er s
block finally over and hi/>s passion for life returned. The mo<ie, however, ends/>
on a rather sinister note. Th< loca/>al <heriff informs Mort that he knows w/>what he
did <nd as soon as they find the/> bodi<es, he ll go to priso/>on. Mort <dismisses the
statement nonchalantly, />and replies that  the ending< is /> the most important part
of t<e story. This one is perfect. />  It is then revealed to us that by <growing
and consu/>ming corn from the g<arden w/>where his ex wife and he< lover are buried,
Mort /> is slowly destroying all the <vidence needed to incr/>riminate him bit by bit.

It should< be noted that this ending/>g is almost the exact o<posite of the
novella s ending. In />the original story, Rai<ne/>y s wife di<sco/>vers Mort s madness,<
and Mort is killed, not his ex wife a/>and her fiance. The story, wh<c/>ch up to t<his
point has been a totall/>y non supernatural tale, takes< on a slightly more spooky
tone, as it />is revealed in a short post<script that Mort s ex wif/>e has received a
letter from Shooter, <telling her />that he is returning to Mississippi to <write a
ne/>w novel. This letter is sent to he<r, after Mort h/>as been killed, suggesti<ng
that Shooter has tak/>ke< on a life of hi/>is own.
