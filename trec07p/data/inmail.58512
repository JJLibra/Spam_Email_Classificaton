The  Raspberry  or  Red Raspberry   Rubus idaeus  is a plant that produces a
tart, sweet, red composite fruit in summer or early autumn. In proper botanical
language, it is not a berry at all, but instead an aggregate fruit of numerous
drupelets around a central core. In raspberry and other species of the subgenus
Idaeobatus, the drupelets separate from the core when picked, leaving a hollow
fruit, whereas in blackberry the drupelets stay attached to the core. The
 [[black raspberry]] , also called a  blackcap , is not the same plant, being a
variety  usually  of Rubus occidentalis, a North American species. Other Rubus
species also called raspberries include   Arctic raspberry  Rubus arcticus 
 Flowering raspberry  Rubus odoratus   Wine raspberry  Rubus phoenicolasius 
 Whitebark raspberry or Western Raspberry  Rubus leucodermis   Bramble raspberry
or Blackberry  Rubus fruticosus  Not all of these are included in the same
subgenus.

It typically grows in forest clearings or fields, particularly where fire or wood 
cutting has produced open space for colonization by this opportunistic colonizer
of disturbed soil. The raspberry flower can be a major nectar source for
honeybees. As a cultivated plant in moist temperate regions, it is easy to grow
and has a tendency to spread unless cut back.

Two types are commercially available  the wild type summer bearing, that
produces an abundance of fruit on second year canes within a relatively short
period in midsummer, and double  or  ever  bearing plants, which also bear a few
fruit on first year canes in the autumn, as well as the summer crop on second 
year canes. In the United States, raspberries can be cultivated from USDA plant
hardiness zones 3 to 9.

Leaves of the raspberry cane are used fresh or dried in herbal and medicinal
teas. The leaves have an astringent fl</STYLE>

r/ //

/Charadriiformes/ is a diverse order of small to medium/large birds. It includes
ab

out 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most
Charadriiformes live near 

water and eat invertebrates or other small animals/
however, some are pelagic /sea birds/,

 some occupy deserts and a few are found
in thick forest.

Systematics The order was forme

rly divided into three suborders/

/ The /[[wader]]s/ /or /Charadrii/// typical shorebirds

, most of which feed by
  probing in the mud or picking items off the surface in both coas

tal and
  freshwater environments.
/ The /[[gull]]s/ and their allies /or /Lari/// these a

re generally larger
  species which take fish from the sea. Several gulls and skuas will a

lso take
  food items from beaches, or rob smaller species, and some have become adapted
 

 to inland environments.
/ The /[[auk]]s/ /or /Alcae// are coastal species which nest on s

ea cliffs and
  /fly/ underwater to catch fish.

The Sibley/Ahlquist taxonomy, which has b

een widely accepted in America, lumps
all the Charadriiformes together with the seabirds a

nd birds of prey into a
greatly enlarged order Ciconiiformes. However, the resolution of t

he DNA/DNA
hybridization technique used by Sibley / Ahlquist was not sufficient to properl

y
resolve the relationships in this group, and indeed it appe
