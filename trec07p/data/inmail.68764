        Dear Reader,

        In a market populated by bright-eyed companies with
        bold visions of market share and abundant success it is
        often difficult to discern those with staying power . .
        . and a real product line. But what can often indicate
        that a company indeed has the 'goods' is third-party
        validation by a well-known market leader. And a market
        leader offering its established credibility to an
        up-and-coming product line may indicate a major
        milestone is just around the corner.

        For example, Sweet Success Enterprises, Inc. (OTC
        BB:SWTS.OB - News) announced today that all seven (7)
        of its ready-to-drink functional beverages will be
        available for sale at Samsclub.com beginning July 1,
        2007. A division of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Sam's Club is
        one of the nation's largest membership warehouse clubs
        offering exceptional values on high quality
        merchandise.

        According to Center for Disease Control statistics, 9.6
        percent of American children and adults suffer from
        diabetes. If Sam's Club's membership of 47 million
        people follow that model as would seem logical, this
        new distribution gives Sweet Success's flagship product
        exposure to an enormous constituency of potential
        consumers. (SEE BREAKING *NEWS* BELOW)

        online website. We are excited to have continual sales
        through the online marketplace,'' says Tom Shuman,
        Sweet Success Senior Vice President of Sales and
        Marketing. ``Today's shoppers are no longer confined to
        the brick and mortar outlets and neither are our
        healthy beverages,'' stated Sweet Success' President,
        Glenn Williamson. ``Expanding our sales to include this
        online e-tailer was a natural next step for the
        continuing growth of our national distribution.''
        William Gallagher, Sweet Success CEO says, ``We believe
        e-commerce retailers could be some of the largest
        distributors for the company.''

        Another e-tailer, Amazon, has received our latest

        San Antonio-based Sweet Success Enterprises, Inc.

        to tap into the rapidly growing demand for convenient
        and nutritious functional beverages. Its line of Fuel

        growing number of stores and includes select
        ingredients that may help to satiate, boost energy and
        immunity and enhance a healthy lifestyle. See the

        ``Safe Harbor'' Statement under the Private Securities
        Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This release includes
        forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the
        safe harbor from liability established by the Private
        Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All
        statements which address actual results could differ
        materially from those expressed or implied in
        forward-looking statements. These statements are made
        on the basis of management's views and assumptions. As
        a result, there can be no assurance that management's
        expectations will necessarily come to pass. These
        forward-looking statements generally can be identified
        by phrases such as management ``believes,''
        ``expects,'' ``anticipates,'' ``foresees,''
        ``forecasts,'' ``estimates'' or other words or phrases
        of similar import. Similarly, statements in this
        release that describe the Company's business strategy,
        outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also
        are forward-looking statements. All such
        forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks
        and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
        differ materially from those in forward-looking
        statements. Management cautions that the ability to
        attract clients and generate business may be affected
        by a decline in the Company's financial ratings, the
        competitive environment, the Company's ability to raise
        sufficient capital to meet the collateral requirements
        associated with its current business and to fund the
        Company's continuing operations and changes in market
        conditions.

        Sweet Success Enterprises, Inc. ("Sweet Success")
        ("SWTS) engages in the production, distribution, and
        marketing of ready-to-drink functional health beverages
        in the U.S. under the trademarked Fuel For Health™
        brand name targeting 4 to 64 year olds.  The
        fast-growing natural and wellness beverage market is
        now approaching $25 billion.

        San Antonio-based Sweet Success Enterprises Inc.
        acquired Nestlé’s original Sweet Success™ brand and has
        re-launched as Fuel for Health™; an all natural product
        line to tap into the rapidly growing demand for all
        natural and self stable health and wellness beverages.
        Sweet Success is now available in a growing number of
        stores and includes select ingredients to satiate,
        boost energy and immunity and enhance a healthy
        lifestyle. Sweet Success® contracts for the production,
        marketing and distribution of all-natural beverages
        under the brand names Sweet Success® Fuel For Health™.

        The Sweet Success product line includes: GlucaSafe®, a
        functional health beverage with green and white tea,
        pomegranate extract and Cinnulin PF® which may support
        healthy glucose metabolism in many individuals;
        Vita-Tein, a protein based beverage available in

        As American's lifestyles have evolved away from soda

        and expanding market of vitamin and mineral enriched
        products.

        Sweet Success now offers a full line of healthy and
        functional beverages that are all-natural, great
        tasting, and are produced with state-of-the-art
        ingredients focused on delivering endurance, heart
        health, and a natural energy boost.  Operating within
        an Exploding Industry, the supplemental beverages that
        SWTS produces have been formulated and reformulated,
        test-marketed, and repositioned in their market space
        for consumers. The work is done and now SWTS is rolling
        out product across the U.S.  Sweet Success’ Fuel for
        Health™ beverages are coming to market at the right
        time; when the demand is high.

        Ground Flax - One of the world's best sources of
        soluble fiber and valuable omega-3 fatty acid. It has
        been shown to improve heart health, lower cholesterol
        and help prevent arthritis.

        Aktivated Barley - A pre-sprouted grain that digests
        slowly for lasting endurance and lowered blood sugar
        levels. It is a great source of immune-boosting

        delicious healthy-lifestyle beverages, announced today
        that the company has filed a patent application
        covering GlucaSafe® -- a beverage developed to maintain
        healthy glucose levels.

        Spurred by the tremendous enthusiasm from the American
        Diabetes Association (ADA) and Juvenile Diabetes
        Research Foundation (JDRF) plus the continued
        acceptance by customers through retail accounts such as
        Amazon.com, H-E-B Grocery and Rice Epicurean, Sweet
        Success(r) has undertaken the filing of a patent
        application to protect this one-of-a-kind, exciting,
        refreshing and delicious beverage.

        "As GlucaSafe® continues to prove its commercial
        viability and becomes our flagship brand, it is
        imperative that we secure this valuable asset with the
        patent process. Today's announcement is both a
        coming-of-age declaration for GlucaSafe® and a window
        into our future efforts to further our Sweet
        Successes," said William Gallagher, CEO of Sweet
        Success Enterprises.

        The diabetes epidemic now encompasses approximately one
        billion people worldwide, with 25% of the U.S.
        population either diabetic or pre-diabetic.
        "GlucaSafe®, in many ways, speaks to the corporate
        karma of the company as we look to simultaneously serve
        our growing shareholder base and consumers by
        manufacturing a great-for-you beverage product. The
        joint dedication to both initiatives is what best
        defines us," said Ben Gallagher, Sweet Success Brand
        Manager and developer of GlucaSafe®.

          Sweet Success' Cooler Program at Southwest's Largest
                   Grocery Chain Generates Expansion
                   to All H-E-B Healthy Living Stores

        SAN ANTONIO, Texas, May 17, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) --
        Sweet Success Enterprises (OTC BB:SWTS.OB - News), the
        maker of a line of innovative and delicious
        healthy-lifestyle beverages, announced that Sweet
        Success' cooler program at the Southwest's largest
        grocery chain generates expansion to all of the H-E-B
        Healthy Living Stores.

        Sweet Success'(r) installation of their specialty 6
        foot Sweet Success single serve coolers encourages
        people to try the product because it is chilled and
        ready to drink. The success of these coolers have
        generated explosive sales and also expansion into all
        H-E-B's Healthy Living Stores. This is the execution of
        our broader marketing program that we developed in
        2005, when we planned to use the Sweet Success red
        coolers with all 7 of our Fuel for Health(tm)
        beverages. "We are excited about the reception of
        single servings of all our beverages by people on the
        go," says William Gallagher, Sweet Success CEO. "This
        also ties in with the strong reception we've had at
        Amazon.com where we've experienced 3 orders during the
        first month at Amazon."

        The # 1 product so far appears to be GlucaSafe(tm),
        which is sponsored by a program that's being
        coordinated with the American Diabetes Association
        (ADA) with their local Expo's and Tour De Cure's, a
        fundraising bicycle ride from San Antonio to Austin, TX
        on May 19th and 20th. The company is participating in
        both the Tour De Cure and an event with the Juvenile
        Diabetes Research Foundation in Atlanta this weekend.

           The No. 4 Ranking of Sweet Success' GlucaSafe Among
           Amazon.com's Movers and Shakers Spurs Expansion to
                       Other E-commerce Retailers

        SAN ANTONIO, May 14, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Sweet
        Success Enterprises (OTC BB:SWTS.OB - News), the maker
        of a line of innovative and delicious healthy-lifestyle
        beverages, announced that the company's revolutionary
        GlucaSafe(r) -- a functional health beverage - was
        ranked no. 4 by Amazon.com Movers and Shakers. This
        ranking has spurred the Company to expand into other
        E-commerce retailers.

        On May 2, 2007, the Company announced that Sweet
        Success(r) products had quickly sold out at Amazon.com.
        Amazon.com was the company's prime choice to enter into
        the electronic markets or "e-tailers" to offer its new
        Fuel for Health(r) line of wellness beverages.

        On Monday, May 7th 2007, the company received a report
        from Amazon.com called Amazon.com Movers & Shakers.
        Amazon.com reported that the biggest gainers in
        Amazon.com's sale rank in the past 24 hours included
        Sweet Success GlucaSafe. GlucaSafe was ranked no. 4 in
        the grocery category following Lancome Hydra Zen
        Moisturizing Cream at no. 3, Neutrogena Triple Moisture
        at no. 2 and Similac Baby Formula at no. 1. "This type
        of initial sales velocity in the electronic market
        place is exciting for us," says William Gallagher,
        Sweet Success CEO. "Initially, we looked at Amazon.com
        as another retailer to join the ranks among grocers
        such as Texas-based H-E-B grocery stores, but now we
        believe e-commerce retailers could be some of the
        largest distributors for the company."

        With recent events at Amazon, the company now believes
        that the electronic retail market could be one of its
        largest sectors of distribution. This broad market
        could include accounts such as online drugstores and
        other retailers, such as the club stores, that have
        brick and mortar outlets as well as thriving online
        sales. "With the global reach of the online market we
        have the capability to span oceans and suddenly be
        retailing in Japan, which already has a huge market for
        health and nutritional products," continued Gallagher.

        E-commerce is not available to most of Sweet Success'
        competition, Odwalla and Naked Juice, because their
        products require refrigeration. All of Sweet Success
        products are shelf stable.

        Seattle, opened on the World Wide Web in July 1995 and

        other sellers offer millions of unique new, refurbished
        and used items in categories such as health and

        music, DVDs, electronics and office, toys and baby, and

        the company also produces Power Blend a juice based
        energy drink, and ChocKoala(tm) Immunity Jr. a non

          Sweet Success Wellness Beverages Available in Texas'
                             Largest Grocer

        SAN ANTONIO, April 25, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Sweet
        Success Enterprises (OTC BB:SWTS.OB - News), maker of a
        line of innovative and delicious healthy-lifestyle
        beverages, announced today the long-awaited
        availability of its Fuel for Health(tm) product line in
        H-E-B Grocery Company stores. Sweet Success offers a
        complete line of shelf stable, all natural functional
        beverages, including GlucaSafe(tm), the only beverage
        containing Cinnilun PF(r), that may support healthy
        glucose levels, as a key ingredient.

        Based in San Antonio, H-E-B employs more than 60,000
        Partners (employees) and serves millions of customers
        in more than 300 stores and 150 communities throughout
        Texas and Mexico.

        The complete line of the seven Fuel for Health
        beverages will be merchandised in Sweet Success coolers
        in select H-E-B Healthy Living stores plus placement on
        the shelf in other Healthy Living stores throughout the
        state. ``A part of our sales and distributions goals is
        to enter accounts we have targeted since we began beta
        testing our products through regional markets in 2005,"
        said William Gallagher, Sweet Success' Chairman and
        CEO. "We are thrilled that we have attained cooler
        space in H-E-B's Healthy Living stores."

        The coolers, which display all seven healthy beverages
        through a glass door, will be prominently placed in the
        high-end stores. While Sweet Success beverages are
        shelf stable, cooler placement will facilitate
        immediate consumption due to impulse buying. Each
        cooler will contain consumer information on functional
        ingredients, benefits and nutritional facts. Shortly
        after cooler placement, Sweet Success will conduct
        in-store demos to allow consumers to sample the all
        natural functional beverage line.

        Sweet Success healthy-lifestyle beverages will be
        delivered to the H-E-B stores by Kehe Food
        Distributors. The Company recently announced an
        agreement whereby the national distributor will carry
        all seven Fuel for Health products.

        San Antonio-based Sweet Success Enterprises, Inc.
        acquired Nestle's original Sweet Success(tm) brand in
        2002 and has re-launched a product line to tap into the
        rapidly growing demand for convenient and nutritious
        functional beverages. Its line of Fuel for Health(tm)
        all-natural beverages is available in a growing number
        of stores and includes select ingredients to satiate,
        boost energy and immunity and enhance a healthy

<p>Dear Reader,
<p>In a market populated by bright-eyed companies with bold visions of
market share and abundant success it is often difficult to discern those
with staying power . . . and a real product line. But what can often indicate
that a company indeed has the 'goods' is third-party validation by a well-known
market leader. And a market leader offering its established credibility
to an up-and-coming product line may indicate a major milestone is just
around the corner.
<p>For example, Sweet Success Enterprises, Inc. (OTC BB:SWTS.OB - News)
announced today that all seven (7) of its ready-to-drink functional beverages
will be available for sale at Samsclub.com beginning July 1, 2007. A division
of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Sam's Club is one of the nation's largest membership
warehouse clubs offering exceptional values on high quality merchandise.
<p>According to Center for Disease Control statistics, 9.6 percent of American
children and adults suffer from diabetes. If Sam's Club's membership of
47 million people follow that model as would seem logical, this new distribution
gives Sweet Success's flagship product exposure to an enormous constituency
of potential consumers. <font color="#000000">(<b>SEE BREAKING *</b></font><b><font color="#CC0000">NEWS</font><font color="#000000">*

the maker of a line of innovative and delicious healthy-lifestyle beverages,

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Sweet
Success'(r) installation of their specialty 6 foot Sweet Success single
serve coolers encourages people to try the product because it is chilled
and ready to drink. The success of these coolers have generated explosive
sales and also expansion into all H-E-B's Healthy Living Stores. This is
the execution of our broader marketing program that we developed in 2005,
when we planned to use the Sweet Success red coolers with all 7 of our
Fuel for Health(tm) beverages. "We are excited about the reception of single
servings of all our beverages by people on the go," says William Gallagher,
Sweet Success CEO. "This also ties in with the strong reception we've had
at Amazon.com where we've experienced 3 orders during the first month at
Amazon."</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>The
# 1 product so far appears to be GlucaSafe(tm), which is sponsored by a
program that's being coordinated with the American Diabetes Association
(ADA) with their local Expo's and Tour De Cure's, a fundraising bicycle
ride from San Antonio to Austin, TX on May 19th and 20th. The company is
participating in both the Tour De Cure and an event with the Juvenile Diabetes

Ranking of Sweet Success' GlucaSafe Among Amazon.com's Movers and Shakers
Spurs Expansion to Other E-commerce Retailers</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>SAN
ANTONIO, May 14, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Sweet Success Enterprises (OTC
BB:SWTS.OB - News)</font></font></font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>,
the maker of a line of innovative and delicious healthy-lifestyle beverages,
announced that the company's revolutionary GlucaSafe(r) -- a functional
health beverage - was ranked no. 4 by Amazon.com Movers and Shakers. This
ranking has spurred the Company to expand into other E-commerce retailers.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>On
May 2, 2007, the Company announced that Sweet Success(r) products had quickly
sold out at Amazon.com. Amazon.com was the company's prime choice to enter
into the electronic markets or "e-tailers" to offer its new Fuel for Health(r)
line of wellness beverages.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>On
Monday, May 7th 2007, the company received a report from Amazon.com called
Amazon.com Movers &amp; Shakers. Amazon.com reported that the biggest gainers
in Amazon.com's sale rank in the past 24 hours included Sweet Success GlucaSafe.
GlucaSafe was ranked no. 4 in the grocery category following Lancome Hydra
Zen Moisturizing Cream at no. 3, Neutrogena Triple Moisture at no. 2 and
Similac Baby Formula at no. 1. "This type of initial sales velocity in
the electronic market place is exciting for us," says William Gallagher,
Sweet Success CEO. "Initially, we looked at Amazon.com as another retailer
to join the ranks among grocers such as Texas-based H-E-B grocery stores,
but now we believe e-commerce retailers could be some of the largest distributors
for the company."</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>With
recent events at Amazon, the company now believes that the electronic retail
market could be one of its largest sectors of distribution. This broad
market could include accounts such as online drugstores and other retailers,
such as the club stores, that have brick and mortar outlets as well as
thriving online sales. "With the global reach of the online market we have
the capability to span oceans and suddenly be retailing in Japan, which
already has a huge market for health and nutritional products," continued
Gallagher.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>E-commerce
is not available to most of Sweet Success' competition, Odwalla and Naked
Juice, because their products require refrigeration. All of Sweet Success
products are shelf stable.</font></font></font>
