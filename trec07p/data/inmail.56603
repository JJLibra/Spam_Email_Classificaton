As    a regional   assistant,  you will   be     supposed     to    operate    with   the payments     from  those customers, based  in  your  country.

The    ideal candidate     will       be industrious,     goal-oriented    person,   with     the     availability     of      a       personal/business  bank       account  suitable    to     be      used       for the    company needs.
