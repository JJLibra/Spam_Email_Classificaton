While we are not big fans of censorship, it is not as if we are talking about bunch of retired army majors and nuns inflicting their will. This is the first time in 10 years that a computer game has managed to get itself banned in the UK and the first time in Ireland. But our acoustic consultant warned us that an untreated floor could act like a giant drumhead, transmitting sound vibrations to our walls and hence to our ceiling. 

Canada isn't exactly known for hours of sunshine, but in some ways it's a good physical location for solar energy, said Ron Kenedi, vice president of Sharp's Solar Energy Solutions Group, who identified Canada as one of Sharp's stronger growth markets at the moment. Days are comparatively long in summer and spring. In winter, sunlight reflected off the snow can generate electricity in silicon solar cells. Cold temperatures and clear weather are actually optimal for solar. 

Ok, now this is getting old. Again this only establishes how immature are those smacktards. 
Open GL baby, go John Carmack and your new Open GL development tools.

Yours truly holding a 12-inch wafer with something that could become the future of CPU packaging
Probably the easiest and most effective way for you to have a permanent entry in wackypedia is to become a pronster, not that I am suggesting you to change your job.

Always preferring to kick a man when he's down...:  The results were impressive. We had originally been concerned about sound leaking directly up through our ceiling, and out through the doors into neighboring, un-soundproofed rooms. After the work was finished, high-frequency stuff like the upper range of Ingrid's marimba simply wasn't audible from our upstairs neighbor's apartment, and low-frequency stuff like bass drum hits were much, much softer. I occasionally rehearse with a piano trio in a professional music studio, and our home soundproofing job is every bit as effective as theirs.  Attach some plain wooden strips to the ceiling, spaced two feet apart. 

With feed-in tariffs, solar panels become profit centers. In Germany, the government gives panel owners around 45 cents for every kilowatt hour fed into the grid, which is more than a kilowatt hour costs. 
"The idea of them even trying to use Safari on other OS's is strange. The first thing that a Mac user does when jumping online, is get another browser. Every Mac I've been on (at an international newspaper) had either IE or Firefox running on it. In fact, about half of the safari browsers would crash or not even start up on a Mac machine... and it's native. Not only that, but when it did run.. it was slower than molasses. I don't know what they're really trying to prove. 

POP-UP MENU 

Bartle led Stephenson to a century-old Edwardian-era house with a south-sloping roof ideal for solar panels, and a yard ripe for an organic garden. With shops and restaurants within walking distance, the lack of a garage for her Toyota Prius hybrid wasn't a deal-breaker. Stephenson moved in this spring. 

So, without further ado, here's a wafer that features insane amount of SRAM memory and has Polaris (80-core) stuck next to it. In the near future, these two would be cut and placed one above the other. 
"Whore!" the woman snapped back and hung up. Caller ID had been blocked. 
"Using one particle to detect and destroy tumours could cut treatment length"Since optical coherence tomography only penetrates up to 2 millimetres, the imaging step will only be useful for locating tumours near the surface, such as cervical, mouth and skin cancers, says Gobin. However, the team plans to modify the nanoshells so that they work with more deeply penetrating radiation, such as X-rays. Houston-based Nanospectra Biosciences, which West co-founded, will begin trials of the spheres in humans in the next two months.

So is this how they retaliate INQ, because they don't want someone spreading to the world about how their encyclopedic-looking articles are so freaking unreliable? Deleting Mageek certainly make it looks a bit less lame, yeah. 

WE HAVE RECEIVED a picture of a 3DMark score from a system running the late and upcoming ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT card. This board was planned to cost around $80, but in reality, you can expect prices to be way lower.
