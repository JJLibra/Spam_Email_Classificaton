A  moth  is an insect closely related to the butterfly. Both are of the order
Lepidoptera. The division of Lepidopterans into moths and butterflies is a
popular taxonomy, not a scientific one. Sometimes the names  Rhopalocera 
 butterflies  and  Heterocera   moths  are used to formalize the popular
distinction. Many attempts have been made to subdivide the Lepidoptera into
groups such as the Microlepidoptera and Macrolepidoptera, Frenatae and Jugatae,
or Monotrysia and Ditrysia. Failure of these names to persist in modern
classifications is due to the fact none of them represents a pair of
 monophyletic groups . The reality is that butterflies are a small group that
arose from within the  moths,  and there is thus no way to group all of the
remaining taxa in a monophyletic group, as it will always exclude that one
descendant lineage.

Most species of moth are nocturnal Which means they are active at night , but
there are crepuscular and diurnal species. They can be distinguished from
butterflies in several ways.

People who study butterflies and/or moths are called lepidopterists  the study
of butterflies is known as butterflying, and the study of moths mothing, the
latter giving rise to the term  mother  for someone who takes part in this
activity mdash sometimes written with a hyphen inserted  moth er  to distinguish
it from the word for a female parent. This confusion does not arise in spoken
English since the two terms are pronounced differently.

Etymology

The Modern English word  Moth  comes from Old English  mo    e   cf.
Northumbrian  moh  e   from Common Germanic  compare Old Norse  motti , Dutch
 Mot  and German  Motte  all meaning  moth  , perhaps its origins are related to
Old English  ma  a  meaning  [[maggot]]  or from the root of  [[midge]]  which
until the 16th century was used mostly to indicate the larva, usually in
reference to devouring clothes.

Economic significance of moths eating a leaf]] Moths, and particularly their
caterpillars, are a major agricultural pest in many parts of the world. The
caterpillar of the gypsy moth  Lymantria dispar  causes severe damage to forests
in the northeast United States, where it is an invasive species. In temperate
climates, the codling moth causes extensive damage, especially to fruit farms.
In tropical and subtropical climates, the diamondback moth  Plutella xylostella 
is perhaps the most serious pest of brassicaceous crops.

Several moths in the family Tineidae are commonly regarded as pests because
their larvae eat fabric such as clothes and blankets made from natural
proteinaceous fibers such as wool or silk. They are less likely to eat mixed
materials containing artificial fibers. There are some reports that they can be
repelled by the scent of wood from juniper and cedar, by lavender, or by other
natural oils. However, many consider this unlikely to prevent infestation.
Naphthalene  the chemical used in mothballs  is considered more effective, but
there are concerns over its effects on human health. Moth larvae may be killed
by freezing the items which they infest for several days at a temperature below
   8   C  18   F . [http //www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7435.html]

Moths are sturdy and usually are more resistant to pesticides than are mosquitos
and flies.

Some moths are farmed. The most notable of these is the silkworm, the larva of
the domesticated moth Bombyx mori. It is farmed for the silk with which it
builds its cocoon. The silk industry produces over 130 million kilograms of raw
silk, worth about 250 million U.S. dollars, each year.     
http //www.indiansilk.kar.nic.in/csb/Statistics/forexchg_tasar/forexchg_tasar_L 
ocal/SilkFlash/RawSilkPrice_tnap.asp gives silk prices in rupees. Exchange rate
is about 50 RS to dollar.
http //www.vegansociety.com/html/animals/exploitation/silk_worm.php gives
productions as 134 mkg     Not all silk is produced by Bombyx mori. There are
several species of Saturniidae that are also farmed for their silk, such as the
Ailanthus moth  [[Samia cynthia]] group of species , the Chinese Oak Silkmoth
 [[Antheraea pernyi]] , the Assam Silkmoth  [[Antheraea assamensis]] , and the
Japanese Silk Moth  [[Antheraea yamamai]] .

The mopane worm, the caterpillar of [[Gonimbrasia belina]], from the family
Saturniidae, is a significant food resource in southern Africa.

Despite being framed for eating clothing, most moth adults do not eat at all.
Most like the Luna, Polyphemus, Atlas, Prometheus, Cercropia, and other large
moths don t have mouths. When they do eat, moths will eat nectar. Only one
species of moth eat wool. The adults do not eat but the larvae will eat through
wool clothing. Attraction to light

 owlet moth attracted by porchlight]]

Moths will circle bright objects, and thus appear to be attracted to light. The
favoured hypothesis advanced to explain this behavior is that moths navigate by
maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as
the Moon. The Moon is so far away, that even after traveling great distances,

act that it was the first to
the United States
Constitution./ref/http///www.state.de.us/gi

c/delfacts/gov.shtml//ref/ Even
though the states were already known as such prior to the 

Constitution, the
motto itself is still historically accurate, as Delaware was indeed the 

first
state to ratify the Articles of Confederation, the first legal document

 the new American political entities as /states/ /although the
Declaration of Independence

 refers to them as /States//. Commemorating
Delaware/s ratification, Constitution Park /on

Other Nicknames //The Diamond 

State/// Thomas Jefferson gave this nickname to
Delaware, according to legend, because he 

described Delaware as a /jewel/ among
states due to its strategic location on the Eastern 

Seaboard.

//Blue Hen State/// This nickname was given to Delaware after the fighting Blue


Hen Cocks that were carried with the Delaware Revolutionary War Soldiers for
entertainmen

//Small Wonder/// This nickname was given to Delaware due to its siz

e, the
contributions it has made to the country as a whole, and due to the state/s
beauty.



Geography


Delaware is the second/smallest state in the United States next to Rhode Isl

and.

Delaware is bounded to the north by Pennsylvania, to the east by the Delaware
River,

 Delaware Bay, New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean and to the west and south
by Maryland. Sm

all portions of Delaware are also situated on the far, or
eastern, side of the Delaware Ri

ver Estuary, and these small parcels share land
boundaries with New Jersey.

The state of 

Delaware, together with the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and
two counties of Virgini

a, form the Delmarva Peninsula, a geographical unit
stretching far down the Mid/Atlantic C

oast.

The definition of the northern boundary of the state is highly unusual. Most of
the

 boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania is defined by an arc extending 12
miles /19 km

/ from the cupola of the courthouse in New Castle, and is referred
to as the Twelve/Mile C

ircle. This is the only true/arc political boundary in
the United States. This border exte

nds all of the way to the low/tide mark on
the New Jersey shore, which continues down the 

shoreline until it again reaches
the twelve/mile arc in the south/ then the boundary conti

nues in a more
conventional way in the middle of the main channel /thalweg/ of the Delawar

e
River Estuary. A portion of this arc extends into Maryland to the west, and the
remainin

g western border is a tangent to this arc that runs a bit to the east.
The Wedge of land b

etween the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both
Delaware and Pennsylvania until

 1921, when Delaware/s claim was confirmed.

Delaware is subdivided into three counties/ f

A  moth />  is an insec<t closely related/> to the butterfly. Both are of the orde<r
Lepidoptera. The division of Lepi/>dopterans into moths and <butterflies is a
p/>popular taxonomy, not a scientific o<ne. Sometimes the names  Rhopalocera />
 butt<erflies  />and  Heterocera   mo<hs  are used to formaliz/>ze the popular
dist<nction. Many attempts have been made t/>o subdivide the Lep<idoptera into
groups such as/> the Microlepidopte<ra and Macr/>olepidoptera, Fre<natae and Jugatae,
or Monotrysia and D/>itrysia. Failure of <these names to persist in mode/>ern
classifications is due<to the fact non/>e of them represents< a pair of
 monophylet/>ic groups . The real<ity is that butterflies a/>re a s<mall group that
arose from within the /> moths,  and there is thus no way <to group all of the
/>remaining taxa in< a monophyletic grou/>p,< />as it will always exclude that one
desce<dant line/>eage.

Most species <of moth are nocturnal Wh/>hich means they are active at night<, but
ther/>re are crepuscular a<d diurnal species. They can be disti/>nguished from
butterflies in several w<ays/>s.

People who study butterflies and/o< moth/>hs<are called lepi/>idopterists  the< study
of butterfli/>es is known as butterflying, and< />the study of moths mothing, the
latter< giving rise to the term  mother  f/>fo< someone who/>o takes part in this
activ<ty mdash somet/>times w<ritten with a hyphen i/>nserted  mot<h er  to di/>stinguish
it from the w<rd for a female parent. /> This co<nfusion does not arise/> in spoken
Engl<ish since the two terms /> are pronounced <ifferently.

Etymo/>logy

The <odern English word  Moth  comes from/>m Old English  m<    e   cf.
Northumbrian  m/>moh<  e   from C/>ommon Germanic  c<ompare Old Norse  motti , Dutch
 M/>Mot  and German  Mott<e  all meaning  moth  , perhaps it/>s origins are related t<o
Old English  ma  a  meaning  [[/>[maggot]]  or from the root of  [[midge<]  which
until the 1/>16th century was u<ed mo/>ostly to <ndicate the larva, us/>sually in
referen<ce/> to de<ouring clothes.

Economi/>ic significance of moths eatin< a leaf]] Moths, and particularl/>y their
cater<pillars, are a major agricultur/>al pest in many parts of the world<. The
caterpillar of the gypsy moth  Lym/>mantria dispar<  causes severe damage to forests/>
in the n<rtheast United States/>s,<where it is an invasive sp/>pe<ies. I/>In tempe<ate
climates, th/>he codli<g moth causes extens/>ive damage, especially to <r/>ruit farms.
<In tropical and subtropical cl/>limates, the dia<ondback moth  Plutella/> xylostella 
<is per/>haps the mo<t serious pest of brassicaceous /> crops.

S<everal moths in the family Tine/>eidae are <ommonly rega/>rded as pests b<cause
th/>eir larvae eat fabric such as clot<hes an/>nd blankets made from natural
prot<inaceous fibers such as wool or si/>ilk. They are less likely to eat mixed<
materials containing a/>rtificial fiber<s. There are some repo/>r<s tha/>at they can be
repelled by <he scent of wood from juniper and/>d< cedar, by lavender, or b/>y othe<
natural oils. However, many consider/> this <unlikely to prevent infestation.
Naphth/>halene  the chemical u<sed in mothba/>lls  is considered more effective, b<t
there are concerns over i/>i<s effects on human health. Moth la/>arvae may< be killed
by freezing the/> items which they infest for s<everal days at a tempe/>erature below
   8   C  18   F . [h<tp //www.ipm/>.ucdavis.edu/PM<G/PESTNOTES/pn743/>5.html]

Moths are <sturdy and usuall/>ly are more< resistant to pesticides than are/> mosquitos
and flies.

Some moths are< farmed. The mo/>st notable< of these is the silkworm, the larva/> of
t<he domesticated moth Bombyx mori. It is /> farmed for the silk with which it
build< its cocoon. The silk industry produces /> over 130 million kilograms of raw
sil<, worth about 2/>50 million U.S. do<lars, each year.

http //www.vegansociety.com/htm<l/animals//>exploitation/silk_worm.php gives<
productions as 134 mkg     Not all silk/> is produced by Bombyx mori.< There are
sev/>eral species of S<turniidae that are also farmed/> for their si<lk, such as the
Ailanthus mo/>th  [[Samia c<ynthia]] group of specie/>s , <he C/>hinese Oak Silkm<oth
 /> [[Antheraea pernyi]] , the As<am Silkm/>mot<  [[Antheraea assamensis]] , a/>and the
Japanese Silk Moth  [[Anthe<aea yamamai]] .

The mop/>pane worm, the caterpillar of<[[Gonimbrasia /> belina]], from the family
Sat<rniidae, is a significant/> food resource in <s/>outhern Africa.

Despite being f<ramed for eati/>ng clothin<g, most moth a/>adults do not eat at all.
Most li<ke/> the Luna, Po<lyphemus, Atlas, Prometheus, Cercropia, /> and o<her large
moths don t have mout/>ths. When they do eat, <oths will eat nectar. Only one
