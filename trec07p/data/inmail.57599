                Specialized Nutritionals for

                Recovery

                Millennium Biotechnologies Group, Inc.
                (“Millennium” or “the Company”) engages
                in the research, development,

                supplements as an adjunct to medical

                conditions, as well as for individuals
                seeking improved recovery and advanced
                performance. The Company’s
                marketed products are targeted toward
                immuno-compromised individuals
                undergoing medical treatment for
                diseases, such as cancer†, as well as
                individuals living with Human
                Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired
                Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and
                for wound healing and post-surgical
                healing, among other conditions.
                Millennium’s three proprietary, marketed
                products, which form the Company’s
                Resurgex® Continuum of Care,
                include Resurgex Select®, Resurgex®, and
                Resurgex Plus®. Resurgex Select® is a
                whole foods-based, calorically
                dense, high-protein nutritional formula
                developed for cancer patients undergoing
                chemotherapy or radiation
                treatments. Resurgex® and Resurgex Plus®
                are specialized, anabolic nutritional
                supplements rich in antioxidants
                that provide nutritional support
                post-treatment. Millennium is also
                developing a Resurgex® Fusion sports
                nutrition
                formula, clinically proven to address
                the nutritional concerns of both
                professional and amateur elite athletes.
                These
                athletes often experience similar
                symptoms post-workout to those battling
                immuno-compromised conditions, such
                as fatigue, loss of lean muscle,
                oxidative stress, and reduced immune
                function. The Company expects to have
                Resurgex® Fusion on the market by late
                2007, with potential marketing
                agreements with the National Collegiate
                Athletic Association (NCAA) and other
                pro-athletic organizations thereafter.
                Millennium is headquartered in Basking
                Ridge, New Jersey, and trades on the
                Over-the-Counter (OTC) market under the
                symbol “MBTG.OB.”

        In stark contrast to the nutritional products
        available in the medical market today, the Resurgex
        formulas combine healthy, whole food calories along
        with a proprietary blend of supportive micro-nutrients.
        Addressing the nutritional needs of individuals
        undergoing medical treatment for such conditions as
        HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and cancer, Millennium’s line of
        nutraceuticals support healthy weight, lean muscle,
        reduced oxidative stress and increased energy
        production. RESURGEX®, RESURGEX Plus™, and RESURGEX
        Select™ are proudly recommended and prescribed at a
        great number of high profile medical institutions
        nationwide.

        Born from its success in the medical market, Resurgex
        nutritionals also play important supportive roles in
        the recovery of professional and amateur level
        athletes. Resurgex products for athletes combine
        unparalleled clinical support for its capacity to aid
        the athlete’s ability to recover quicker so as to
        perform at a higher level. The variation in caloric
        levels, all while providing the same advanced
        micro-nutrient profile, makes the Resurgex line ideal
        for the endurance as well as strength athlete.

        Convenient dosing formats, premier flavor systems,
        third party insurance coverage and multiple
        distribution outlets helps to increase adherence and
        availability of the Resurgex line amongst its users.
        Millennium plans to continue building its product line
        in its quest to provide optimal and proprietary
        nutritional support for the medical as well as the
        athletic communities.

        Millennium is currently in the process of redesigning
        and restructuring the company to better suit its two
        primary core competitancies of identified care for
        athletes and cancer patients. Millennium plans to file
        with the Securities and Exchange Commission and mail to
        its stockholders a proxy statement which will contain
        information about Millennium, the sale of its assets
        and the formation and capitalization of RAC Nutrition
        (the "Proposed Transaction") and related matters.

            Resurgex® Provides Strength And Body Composition
                          Benefits To Athletes

             Millennium Biotechnologies, Inc. recently
             announced preliminary results of its second
             double blind, placebo controlled clinical
             trial that found its Resurgex® nutritional
             formula provided improvements in strength
             (Wingate testing) and increased lean muscle
             gain while reducing body fat in Rutgers
             University Division 1 football players
             (strength athletes). The preliminary results
             showed Resurgex® out performed a leading
             sports nutritional formula commonly used by
             athletes. This emerging new data, coupled
             with the first trial that found its Resurgex®
             nutritional formula provided enhanced
             performance parameters and reduced oxidative
             stress levels (free radical damage caused by
             exercise) in Rutgers University Division 1
             soccer players (endurance athletes), further
             suggests an important role for Resurgex in
             the sports fitness field.  - BioSpace.com

                 Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Study

        Improved Body Composition:  while both groups gained
        weight, the Resurgex (experimental) group gained muscle
        and lost a slight amount of body fat while the Gatorade
        Performance Shake (control) group gained ½ of their
        weight as body fat

        Improved Power/Strength: using Wingate Testing, Peak
        power was measured for each test and standardized by
        body weight. The increase in peak power in the Resurgex
        group was approximately 86% greater than the increase
        in the Gatorade Performance Shake group.

        Improved Recovery Parameters: the Resurgex group had a
        significant improvement in their testosterone:cortisol
        ratio while the Gatorade Performance Shake group had a
        decrease in this ratio.

             Purchase order provides for Distribution in the
           Philippines with anticipated expansion into Korea,
           Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan and
                                Indonesia

        BASKING RIDGE, N.J., May 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ --
        Millennium Biotechnologies, Inc. a wholly owned
        subsidiary of Millennium Biotechnologies Group, Inc.
        (OTC Bulletin Board: MBTG - News) announced today that
        it has received a $238,000 purchase order from New
        Marketlink Pharmaceutical Corp., a Philippine
        pharmaceutical company for the distribution and
        marketing of its Resurgex® product line for the
        oncology market.

        New Marketlink Pharmaceutical Corp. will distribute and
        market the line of Resurgex® products for cancer
        patients in the Philippines. Following the launch in
        the Philippines distribution is expected to expand to
        Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan
        and Indonesia. As for all new products which are
        imported into the Philippines the purchase order is
        subject to the issuance of a certificate of product
        registration. The certificate of product registration
        is subject to approval by the Philippine Regulatory
        Agency (BFAD).

        "Recently, several distribution channels have opened up
        to Resurgex ® products due to the overwhelming
        recognition of the superiority of the Resurgex®
        ingredients compared with other products in the market
        place. We expect this is the first of those to trigger
        revenue growth along with the recently announced P4
        Healthcare product launch scheduled for June 2007,"
        said Jerry Swon, Sr., President of Millennium
        Biotechnologies Group, Inc. For more information on P4
        Healthcare, please visit their website at
        http://www.caring4cancer.com

        Resurgex Select® was developed to provide a superior
        source of high- quality calories as opposed to the corn
        oil and corn syrup-laden products that are found in the
        marketplace. As with the previous patent issued for
        Resurgex®, this additional patent serves to protect the
        intellectual property of Millennium's new addition to
        the Resurgex® family of products.

Immuno-Compromised Conditions &amp; Sports Recovery</font></font></b><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b>Millennium Biotechnologies Group, Inc.</b> (“Millennium” or “the
Company”) engages in the research, development,
<br>and marketing of specialized nutritional supplements as an adjunct
to medical treatments for select medical
<br>conditions, as well as for individuals seeking improved recovery and
advanced performance. The Company’s
<br>marketed products are targeted toward immuno-compromised individuals
undergoing medical treatment for
<br>diseases, such as cancer†, as well as individuals living with Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired
<br>Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and for wound healing and post-surgical
healing, among other conditions.
<br>Millennium’s three proprietary, marketed products, which form the Company’s
Resurgex&reg; Continuum of Care,
<br>include Resurgex Select&reg;, Resurgex&reg;, and Resurgex Plus&reg;.
Resurgex Select&reg; is a whole foods-based, calorically
<br>dense, high-protein nutritional formula developed for cancer patients
undergoing chemotherapy or radiation
<br>treatments. Resurgex&reg; and Resurgex Plus&reg; are specialized, anabolic
nutritional supplements rich in antioxidants
<br>that provide nutritional support post-treatment. Millennium is also
developing a Resurgex&reg; Fusion sports nutrition
<br>formula, clinically proven to address the nutritional concerns of both
professional and amateur elite athletes. These
<br>athletes often experience similar symptoms post-workout to those battling
immuno-compromised conditions, such
<br>as fatigue, loss of lean muscle, oxidative stress, and reduced immune
function. The Company expects to have
<br>Resurgex&reg; Fusion on the market by late 2007, with potential marketing
agreements with the National Collegiate
<br>Athletic Association (NCAA) and other pro-athletic organizations thereafter.
Millennium is headquartered in Basking
<br>Ridge, New Jersey, and trades on the Over-the-Counter (OTC) market
under the symbol “MBTG.OB.”</td>

<blockquote>Millennium Biotechnologies, Inc. recently announced preliminary
results of its second double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial that
found its Resurgex&reg; nutritional formula provided improvements in strength
(Wingate testing) and increased lean muscle gain while reducing body fat
in <u>Rutgers University Division 1 football players</u> (strength athletes).
The preliminary results showed Resurgex&reg; out performed a leading sports
nutritional formula commonly used by athletes. This emerging new data,
coupled with the first trial that found its Resurgex&reg; nutritional formula
provided enhanced performance parameters and reduced oxidative stress levels
(free radical damage caused by exercise) in <u>Rutgers University Division
1 soccer players</u> (endurance athletes), further suggests an important
role for Resurgex in the sports fitness field.&nbsp; - <i>BioSpace.com
