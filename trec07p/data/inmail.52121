<font face="Arial narrow" color=cccc99><b>JOKES OF THE DAY</b><BR>
<I>Pondering Old Age </I><BR>
How do I know that my youth is all spent?<BR>
Well, my get up and go has got up and went.<BR>
But in spite of it all I am able to grin<BR>
when I recall where my get up has been.<BR>
Old age is golden-so I've heard it said-<BR>
but sometimes I wonder when I get into bed,<BR>
with my ears in a drawer and my teeth in a cup,<BR>
my eyes on the table until I wake up.<BR>
Are sleep dims my eyes I say to myself,<BR>
"Is there anything else I should lay on the shelf?"<BR>
And I'm happy to say as I close my door,<BR>
my friends are the same, perhaps even more.<BR>
When I was young, my slippers were red,<BR>
I could pick up my heels right over my head.<BR>
When I grew older, my slippers were blue,<BR>
but still I could dance the whole night through.<BR>
But now I am old, my slippers are black,<BR>
I walk to the store and puff my way back.<BR>
The reason I know my youth is all spent,<BR>
my get up and go has got up and went.<BR>
But I really don't mind when I think, with a grin,<BR>
of all the grand places my get up has been.<BR>
Since I have retired from life's competition,<BR>
I accommodate myself with complete repetition.<BR>
I get up each morning, and dust off my wits,<BR>
pick up my paper and read the "obits".<BR>
If my name is missing, I know I'm not dead,<BR>
so I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed.

<I>The Old Lady </I><BR>
A family took their frail, elderly mother to a nursing home and left her, hoping she would be well cared for.
The next morning, the nurses bathed her, fed her a tasty breakfast, and set her in a chair at a window overlooking a lovely flower garden. She seemed okay, but after a while she slowly started to tilt sideways in her chair.
Two attentive nurses immediately rushed up to catch her and straighten her up. Again she seemed okay, but after a while she slowly started to tilt over to her other side.
The nurses rushed back and once more brought her back upright. This went on all morning. 
Later, the family arrived to see how the old woman was adjusting to her new home. "So Ma, how is it here? Are they treating you all right?"
"It's pretty nice," she replied. "Except they won't let me fart."<BR><I>The Hearing Aid</I> <BR>
An elderly gentleman had serious hearing problems for a number of years.<BR> 
He went to the doctor and the doctor was able to have him fitted for a set of hearing aids that allowed the gentleman to hear 100%.<BR> 
The elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and the doctor said, "Your hearing is perfect. Your family must be really pleased that you can hear again."<BR> 
The gentleman replied, "Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just sit around and listen to the conversations. I've changed my will three times!" <BR>
