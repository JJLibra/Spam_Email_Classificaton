website   [http   www.fulda.de  fulda.de]/     Fulda  is a city in Hesse,
Germany  it is located on the Fulda River and is the administrative seat of the
Fulda district  Kreis .

History Early Middle Ages The Benedictine monastery of Fulda was founded in 744
by Saint Sturm, a disciple of Saint Boniface, as one of Boniface s outposts in
the reorganization of the church in Germany, and a base from which missionaries
accompanied Charles the Great s  Charlemagne s  armies in their political and
military campaign to destroy heathen Saxony.

The initial grant for the abbey was signed by Carloman, the son of Charles
Martel. The support of the Mayors of the Palace and later, the early Pippinid
and Carolingian rulers, was important to Boniface s success. Fulda also received
support from many of the leading families of the Carolingian world. Sturm, whose
tenure as abbot lasted from 747 until 779, was most likely related to the
Agilolfing dukes of Bavaria. Fulda also received large and constant donations
from the Etichonids, a leading family in Alsace, and the Conradines,
predecessors of the Salian Holy Roman Emperors. Under Sturm, the donations Fulda
received from these and other important families helped in the establishment of
daughter houses Johannesberg and Petersberg near Fulda.

 and being martyred, from the Sacramentary of Fulda]] After his martyrdom by the
 Frisians, the relics of Saint Boniface were brought back to Fulda. Because of
 the stature this afforded the monastery, the donations increased, and Fulda
 could establish daughter houses further away, for example in Hameln. Meanwhile
 Saint Lullus, successor of Boniface as archbishop of Mainz, tried to absorb the
 abbey into his archbishopric, but failed. This was one reason that he founded
 Hersfeld Abbey, to limit the attempts of the enlargement of Fulda.

Between 790 and 819 the community rebuilt the main monastery church to more
fittingly house the relics. They based their new basilica on the original 4th 
century  since demolished  Old Saint Peter s Basilica in Rome, using the
transept and crypt plan of that great pilgrimage church to frame their own saint
as the  Apostle to the Germans . The crypt of the original abbey church still
holds those relics, but the church itself has been subsumed into a Baroque
renovation. A small, 9th century chapel remains standing within walking distance
of the church, as do the foundations of a later women s abbey.

The great scholar Rabanus Maurus was abbot from 822 to 842.

   From its foundation on the abbey Fulda and its territory was based on an
Imperial grant and therefore a sovereign principality subject only to the German
emperor. Fulda was made a bishopric in 1752 and the prince abbots were given the
additional title of prince bishop. The prince abbots  and later prince bishops 
ruled Fulda and the surrounding region until the bishopric was forcibly
dissolved by Napoleon s minions in 1802.

The city went through baroque building campaign in the 1700 s resulting in the
current    Baroque City    status. This included a remodel of the Dom of Fulda
 1704 1712  and the Fulda Stadtschloss  1707 1712  by Johann Dientzenhofer. The
city parish church, St. Blasius, was built between 1771   1785.

>From 1764 until 1789 Fulda had a porcelain factory. Because of its quality and
rarity, it is much prized by collectors. The factory was begun under Prince 
Bishop, Prince Abbot Heinrich von Bibra and closed down shortly after his death
by his successor, Prince Bishop, Prince Abbot Adalbert von Harstall.
