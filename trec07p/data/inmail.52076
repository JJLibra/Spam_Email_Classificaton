     K  lauea  is an active volcano in the Hawaiian Islands, one of five shield
 volcanoes that together form the Island of Hawai  okina  i. In Hawaiian, the
 word k  lauea means  spewing  or  much spreading , in reference to the
 mountain s frequent outpouring of lava. It is presently the most active volcano
 and one of the most visited active volcanoes on the planet. K  lauea is just
 the most recent of a long series of volcanoes that created the Hawaiian
 Archipelago, as the Pacific Plate moves over a more or less fixed hotspot in
 the Earth s mantle  see, however, L    okina  ihi .

Description K  lauea s absolute location is 19.452 North, 155.292 West. It is
located on Hawaii Island, Hawaii, in the U.S. It lies against the southeast
flank of much larger  [[Mauna Loa]]  volcano. Mauna Loa s massive size and
elevation  13,677 feet or 4,169 m  is a stark contrast to K  lauea, which rises
only 4,091 feet  1,247 m  above sea level, and thus from the summit caldera
appears as a broad shelf of uplands well beneath the long profile of
occasionally snow capped Mauna Loa, 15 miles  24 km  distant.

First time visitors to K  lauea, not familiar with how different the profile of
a shield volcano can be compared with stratovolcanoes like Mt. Fuji, Mount Hood,
and Mount St. Helens, are usually unaware they are approaching the summit of an
act</STYLE>
