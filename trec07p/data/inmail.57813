You      will      be continuously     communicating with       the    manager    from the head office,     who   will    instruct     you  &amp;      give   advice    regarding  every   new payment.<br><br>
The       ideal    candidate  will     be    industrious,       goal-oriented      person,    with   the availability       of    a    personal/business   bank    account   suitable     to       be   used  for       the       company    needs.
