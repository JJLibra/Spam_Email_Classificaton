<br>
Redijet was founded by jet travelers for jet travelers. We are committed to 
creating an experience so different you won&rsquo;t be able to keep it to yourself. Our programs are designed specifically to cater to your specific needs, not the needs of our company. We feel so strongly that if we focus solely on our clients&rsquo; every need, then Redijet&rsquo;s very own success is imminent. Shop and compare prices and service to the competition. Redijet has no down time dates because we know your travel needs are 24/7, 365 days per year. We offer personalized catering on all of your flights. Ask our accomodating staff for details. Our clients receive the highest level of service and attention all at a lower cost than the leading competition. </p>
<p>
<span class="subTitle">The Planes</span><br>
<br>
 Designed for businesses by business travel experts, Redijet's program uses 
Embraer and Raytheon aircraft for the ultimate in reliability, efficiency and 
luxurious accommodation. Our jets provide business travelers with plenty of room 
to refresh themselves and focus on business results rather than business travel. 
Your staff will experience comfortable seating, large and convenient work 
surfaces and exceptional acoustic soundproofing.</p>
<p><span class="subTitle">  The Pilots</span><br>
  <br>
  Like all facets of our business, our pilot selection standards are 
unsurpassed as part of Redijet&rsquo;s commitment to maintain an impeccable level of safety for our clients.</p>
<P>Redijet&rsquo;s crewmember selection process is very demanding and assures that only the very best pilots are selected to be the front line ambassadors for Redijet. All of our crewmembers are FAA captain qualified, trained by nationally recognized training organizations Simcom, Simuflite, and Flight Safety. This training is accompanied by our own company training that covers such aspects as safety and security for our clients as well as all other pertinent company related subjects.</P>
<P>How did we get such great pilots? The standards of our organization, our perfect safety record, disciplined aircraft maintenance, and reputation for service are a draw to conscientious pilots. The best pilots are also drawn to Redijet for some of the same reasons you are: a chance to be more in control of their travel schedule than major airlines permit, getting home to families or loved ones at the end of a day, and a more personal and engaging way of serving customers who they come to regard as friends.</P>
<P><span class="subTitle">Our Service</span></P>
<P>Whether you need to connect to your business or your next destination, our professional and capable customer service representatives and energetic concierge staff will ensure that your trip begins and ends well.</P>
