 Lima , capital of Lima Province, is both the capital and largest city in Peru.
It is the cultural and economic hub of the country. Lima occupies the valleys of
the Chill  n, R  mac and Lur  n rivers. It lies on a desertic coast overlooking
the Bay of Lima in the Pacific Ocean where its port was built and named Callao.

Lima was founded by Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro on January 18, 1535,
as the  City of Kings . It became the most important city in the Spanish
Viceroyalty of Peru, an administrative area encompassing most of Spain s
possessions in South America during the colonial era  mid 1500s to early 1800s .
For more than three centuries, Lima was the greatest metropolis in South
America. Today nearly one third of the nation s population lives in this one
metropolitan area.

Geography Geology

The city of Lima  urban area  covers about 800 km  . It is located on mostly
flat terrain in the Peruvian coastal plain, within the valleys of the Chill  n,
R  mac and Lur  n rivers. The city slopes gently from the shores of the Pacific
Ocean into valleys and mountain slopes located as high as 500 mASL. Within the
city exist isolated hills which are not connected to the surrounding hill
chains, such as El Agustino, San Cosme, El Pino, La Milla, Muleria and Pro
hills. The San Cristobal hill, which directly faces north of the downtown area,
is the local extreme of an Andean hill outgrowth.

While no official administrative definition for the city exists, it is usually
considered to be comprised of the central 30 out of the 43 districts of Lima
Province, corresponding to an urban area centered on the historic Cercado de
Lima district. The city is the core of the Lima Metropolitan Area, one of the
ten largest metropolitan areas in the Americas.

The location of the city was decided at Epiphany  January 6 , the day of the
Three Kings, and Francisco Pizarro named it Tres Veces Coronada Ciudad de los
Reyes. Lima, its original name, however, persisted. It is uncertain where the
name originated  it may derive either from the Aymara word lima limaq,  yellow
flower  or from Quechuan rimaq  talking . In the oldest Spanish maps of Peru,
Lima and Ciudad de los Reyes  City of Kings  can be seen together as names of
the city. The river that feeds Lima is still called Rimac, Quechua for  Talking
river   R  o Hablador in Spanish .

Cityscape

 on the San Isidro district.]] Lima neighborhoods display a degree of diversity
 well befitting the largest city in Peru. Much of this is an artifact of the
 city s history of growth by annexation, which allowed distinct environments to
 arise in many areas  indeed, many Lima neighborhoods, such as La Molina, San
 Juan de Lurigancho and Chorrillos are fairly close knit, culturally distinctive
 communities.

Climate Lima s climate is quite mild, despite being located in the Tropics. Lima
has a subtropical and desertic climate, yet the microclimate also makes it very
humid. The temperatures vary from mild to warm  neither very cold or hot .The
average temperature is 18  C to 19  C  60 65  F . The lowest temperatures vary
from 50s  F  12  C  to around 68  F  20  C  and the high average is around
78  F, with 30  C  89  F  in the warmest of days. One must remember to wear
tight sweaters  no jackets are needed  in the winters due to colder sensation
through high humidity and never forget to put sun block on the beach during
summers, even though a bit cloudy the sun rays still hit as stronger or stronger
than any other region in the Tropics.


Relative humidity is very high, and produces brief morning fog from June to
December and persistent low clouds from May to November. Sunny, less moist and
warm summers follow from December to April and are followed by cloudy, damp and
cool winters  June to October. Rainfall is almost unknown. The yearly average of
0.7 cm  0.3in  reported at the airport is the lowest of any large metropolitan
area in the world. Inland</STYLE>

// /Potsdam/ is the capital city of the federal state of Brandenburg in Germany.
It is sit

uated on the Havel River, southwest of Berlin. It is a part of the
Metropolitan area Berli

n/Brandenburg.

Potsdam is known as the former residence of the Prussian kings until 1918.

 The
city features a series of interconnected lakes and unique cultural landscapes,
in par

ticular the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, the largest World Heritage
Sites in Germany.



The Potsdam district of Babelsberg also serves as one of the leading centers of
European f

ilm production. The Filmstudio Babelsberg has significant historical
value as the oldest l

arge/scale film studio in the world. The Deutsches
Filmorchester Babelsberg frequently rec

ords soundtracks for domestic and foreign/
based film productions.

The city developed int

o a center of science in Germany since the 19th century.
Today there are 3 public High sch

ools and more than 30 research/institutes in
Potsdam.

Geography

Potsdam is situated sout

h/west of Berlin. The area was formed from a series of
large moraines during the last ice 

age. Today the city consists of 75/ green
area, with just 25/ covered with buildings or st

reets. There are about 20 lakes
and rivers in Potsdam, for example the Havel, the Griebnit

zsee, Templiner See,
Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See and the Sacrower S

ee. The
tallest hill is the 114/meter/high Kleiner Ravensberg.

Potsdam is divided into 7 

historic city districts and 9 new Ortsteile /village
parts/, which joined the city in 2003

. The appearance of the city districts is
quite different. The districts in the north and 

the in the center consist mainly
of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominat

ed by larger areas of
newer buildings.

History in 993 mentioning Poztupimi.]] ]] Potsdam 

was probably founded in the
7th century as a Slavic village called Poztupimi, centred on a

 castle. A
possible translation of the name might be beneath the oaks. It was first
mentio

ned in writing in 993, and by 1317 it was mentioned as a small town, by
now German, which 

gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573 it was still a small
market town of 2000 inhabita

nts. The Thirty Years/ War /1618 / 1648/ destroyed
nearly half the town.

Potsdam/s fortun

es changed dramatically when it was chosen in 1660 as the
hunting residence of Frederick W

illiam I, elector of Brandenburg, the core of
the powerful state that later became the Kin

gdom of Prussia. It also housed a
Prussian barracks.

After the Edict of Potsdam in 1685 P

otsdam became a centre of European
immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people fro

m France /Huguenots/,
Russia, the Netherlands, and Bohemia. The edict allowed a faster pop

ulation
growth and a recovery of the economy.

Later the city was adopted as a full reside

nce of the Prussian royal family. The
majestic buildings of the royal residence were built

 mainly during the reign of
Frederick the Great. One of these buildings is the Sanssouci P

alace /French/
/without cares/, by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744/, famed for its


formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other buildings in the royal residence
complex inclu

de the Neues Palais and the Orangery.

While Berlin was the official capital of Prussia an

d later of the German Empire,
the court remained in nearby Potsdam, where many government 

officials settled.
In 1914 the Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the New

 Palace
in Potsdam. The city lost this status as a second capital in 1918, when World
War 

I ended and Wilhelm II abdicated.

At the beginning of the Third Reich a ceremonial handsh

ake between President
Paul von Hindenburg and the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler took place o

 Lima , capi<tal of Lima Pro/>ovince, is both th< capital and largest city i/>n Peru.<It is the cultural and/>d econom<c hub of the cou/>un<ry. Lima occupies/> the valleys o<f
the Chill  n, R  mac an/>nd Lur  n rivers. It lies on< a desertic coast overlooking
the/> <Bay of Lima in the Pacific Ocean w/>here its port was built a<nd named/> Callao.

Lima was founded by Spani<s/>h conquistador Francisco Pizarro on Ja<nuary 18, 1535,
as the  City of K/>Kings . It became the mo<t important city in the Spanis/>sh
Vice<oyalty of Peru, an ad/>ministrati<ve area encompassing most of Spain/>n s
p<ssession/>s in South America during <the colonial era  mid 1500s to ea/>rly 1800s .
For more than three centur<es, Lima was the greatest /> metropolis <n South
America. Today nearly one /> third of the nation < population lives in t/>this one
metropolitan area.

G<ography Geology

The city of L/>Lima  urban are<  covers about 800/>0 km  . It is located on mostly
<flat terrain in the Peruvian coastal pla/>in, within <the valleys of the Chill  n,
R  />mac and Lur  n rivers. The c<ty slopes /> gently from <he shores of the P/>Pacific
Ocean into valleys and mo<ntain slopes located as high as 500 mASL/>. Within the
city exist <isolated hill/>ls which are not<connected to the surrounding hill
ch/>ains, such as El Agustin<o, San Cosme, E/>l Pino, La Milla, Muleria and Pro
hil<s. The San Cristobal hill, which d/>directly face< north of the d/>downtown area,
is the local extr<me of an An/>dean hill outgrowth.

While no offici<al administrative definition/>n fo< the city exists, it is usually
consi/>dered to be comprised of the c<n/>ntral 30 out of<the 43 districts of Lima
P/>rovince, corresponding to an ur<ban /> area centered on <he historic Cercado de
Lima /> district. The <ity is the core of the Lima Met/>ropolitan Area, one of th<e
ten largest metropolitan a/>areas in the Americas.

The loca<ion of the c/>city was decided at Epiphany  Jan<ary 6 , the day of the
Three Kings,/> and Francisco Pizarro named it Tre<s Veces Coronada Ciudad de los/>
R<eyes. Lima, its original name/>e, however, persisted. It is uncertain w<ere the
na/>me originated  it m<y derive either from /> the Aymara <word lima li/>maq,  yellow
flower  or from Quech<uan rimaq  talking . In the oldest Spani/>ish ma<s of Peru,
Lima and/>d Ciudad de los Reyes  <City of Kings  can be seen together as n/>ames of
the city. The <river />that< feeds />Lima is still call<ed Rimac,/>, Quechua for  Talking
r<ver   R  o Hablador in S/>Spanish .

Cityscape

 o< the San Isidro district.]] Lima /> neighborhoods display a<degree of diversity
 well befitting /> the largest city in Peru. Much of<this is an artifact of t/>the
 city s history of growth <y anne/>exa<ion, /> which allowed <istinct environments /> to
 arise in many areas  indeed, many <Lima neighb/>orhoods, such as La Molina, San
 J<uan de Luri/>gancho and Chorrillos are fair<ly clos/>e kni<t, culturally />distinctive
 communities.

Climate Lim<a s climate is quite mild, despite b/>being loca<ed in the Tropics. Lima
has a subtropi/>cal <and desertic />climate, y<et the />microclimate a<lso makes it very/>
humid. The temperatures vary fr<om mild to warm  nei/>ther very<cold/> or hot .The
average temper<ature is 18  C to 19  C  60 65  F ./> The lowest temperatures <vary
from 50s  F  12 /> C  to around 68  F  20  C  a<nd the high a/>verage is around
78  F, with <30/>0  C  89  F  in the warmest o<f days. One must re/>member to wear
t<ight sweaters  no jackets are needed />  in the winters due t< colder sensation
through /> hig< humidity and never forge/>et to put sun block on the beach<during
summers, even though a bit cloudy/>y the sun ra<ys still hit as/>s stronger or stronger
than any <ther region in />the Tropics.


Relative humidity is <ery high, and produces brief morning/>g fog from June to
December<and persistent low clouds from May to N/>ove<mber. Sunny, l/>ess moist <nd
warm summers follow /> from De<ember to April a/>nd are foll<owed by cloudy, dam/>p< and
cool winters/>  June to October. Rainfall is <lmost unknown. The yearly average o/>of
0.7 cm  0<3in  reported at the airport is the lowe/>est of any large met<ropolitan
area in the world./> Inland/></STYLE><p><HR width="90%" SIZE=1><p><center>
