Can you return a phone call? Could you do it if it made you good moolah? Then call the information line to hear how.

Oh the sun is shining and things are better each day.

I get to stay home and relax on my porch while I simply return phone calls
each day. This can be you also if you want it to be.

The potential to generate up to $3OOO each week is there
so pick up that telephone and call my information line.

After losing the glare offensive, the five soldiers of her hand started creeping towards me. These soldieries were not communists any more, if they were, they would have snatched me by now. I can feel the vibration, caused by the creeping of her hand, falling into my bones. Although her hand is yet to touch mine; the oscillation of that heart-soothing near future has made my hand to frustratingly wont for a passionate hug of that slender-finger neighbor.
