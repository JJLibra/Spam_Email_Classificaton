Imagine    being  part   of      a       stable    organization       with       a  sterling  reputation  -   a   place       where the  Sydney      Car Centre      is  an     integral      part   of  all       that we    do. With    our     car    centre     personality, you'll       not   just      succeed    -     you'll   thrive.

Today    the      Sydney   Car       Centre is looking    for       an    industrious     regional       assistant     to      fasten  the   process      of    the  delivery   of     customer     payments  to   the  suppliers.     The       position   offered   is   a   part-time   job,       and    will      only      require   from       you  to   be       available   for  1-2     hours      a day.<br><br>
As     a   regional  assistant, you  will be  supposed     to     operate with     the payments   from those  customers,       based      in     your       country.      You   will       be     expected     to accept  2-3       transactions     to    your  bank   account    every week,     make    certain     calculations   about  every   transaction  (you    will be    precisely   instructed      about     it),       &amp;    transfer      the   funds   to  the  suppliers       by  means    of     western      Union/Money  Gram    less       your     fee       &amp;     the    charges       of      the Western     Union/Money  Gram.    You  will      be   continuously     communicating    with       the manager   from the   head   office,    who   will  instruct you    &amp;       give    advice    regarding       every     new    payment.<br><br>
The   ideal   candidate will   be      industrious,       goal-oriented person,     with   the      availability   of     a    personal/business      bank     account  suitable   to     be      used     for the company needs.  Knowledge     of   English,   computer   literacy   and  sociability   are      appreciated.<br><br>

All    the       related expenses      you       might have      (like the      Western    Union/Money     Gram      chargers,   related     expenses    on traveling)  are covered      by    the  company.<br><br>
