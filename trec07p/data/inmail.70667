<STYLE>, Norway]]

A  fjord   or  fiord   is a long, narrow estuary with steep sides, made when a
glacial valley is flooded by the sea. The seeds of a fjord are laid when a
glacier cuts a U shaped valley through abrasion of the surrounding bedrock by
the rocks and sediment it carries. Many such valleys were formed during recent
ice ages when the sea was at a much lower level than it is today. At the end of
such a period, the climate warms up again and glaciers retreat. Sea level rises
due to an influx of water from melting ice sheets and glaciers around the world
 it rose over 100 nbsp m after the last ice age , inundating the vacated valleys
with seawater to form fjords.

Fjords are often very deep in their upper and middle reaches, in the case of
Norway s Hardangerfjord dropping 800 m  2,624 ft  below sea level, although
fjords generally have a sill or rise at their mouth associated with the previous
glacier s terminal moraine.

Etymology With Indo European origin   prt  s from  por  or  per  in the verb
fare  travelling/ferrying , the Norse noun substantive fj  r  r means a  Lake 
like  waterbody used for passage and ferrying.

The Scandinavian Fjord is the origin for similar European words  Icelandic
fj  r  ur, Swedish fj  rd  for Baltic waterbodies , English ford, Scottish
firth, and is related to  Greek poros, Latin portus, German Furt.

As a loanword from Norwegian, it is the only word in the English language to
start with the digraph fj.

Scandinavian usage Use of the word fjord  including the eastern Scandinavian
form fj  rd  is more general in the Scandinavian languages than in English. In
Scandinavia, fjord is used for a narrow inlet of the sea in Norway, Denmark and
western Sweden, but this is not its only application. In Norway, the usage is
closest to the Old Norse, with fjord used for both a firth and for a long,
narrow inlet. In eastern Norway, the term is also applied to long narrow
freshwater lakes and sometimes even to rivers  in local usage, for instance in
Fl   in Hallingdal, the Hallingdal river is referred to as fjorden . In east
Sweden, the name fj  rd is used in a synonymous manner for bays, bights and
narrow inlets on the Swedish Baltic Sea coast, and in most Swedish lakes. This
latter term is also used for bodies of water off the coast of Finland where
Finland Swedish is spoken. In modern Icelandic, fj  r  ur is still used with the
broader meaning of firth or inlet. In Finnish language, a word vuono is used
although there is only one fjord in Finland.

The German use of the word F  rde on sea stretches on their Baltic Sea
coastline, seems to indicate a common Germanic origin of the word. The landscape
consists mainly of moraine heaps, and  real  fjords in the geological sense are
not </STYLE>
