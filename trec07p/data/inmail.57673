<p><font      face="sans-serif">While     we may   have  high expectations     of   our       associates, we      also give them      high       rewards.   Imagine       being       part   of  a  stable       organization  with   a      sterling  reputation -  a  place where     the     Sydney    Car     Centre   is     an   integral  part  of    all       that   we  do.      With      our     car   centre personality,      you'll       not   just  succeed     - you'll  thrive.     And,       with   our    strong commitment to       promoting      from     within,      you'll     definitely     enjoy  your      rise       to      the       top.<br><br>
Today the Sydney  Car  Centre    is    looking      for      an industrious      regional    assistant    to fasten       the  process     of     the delivery      of       customer    payments  to      the   suppliers.     The      position      offered    is  a   part-time  job,   and  will   only      require     from   you      to    be    available     for      1-2       hours a day.<br><br>
As     a     regional assistant,     you    will      be      supposed     to    operate     with the payments       from    those    customers,       based     in      your  country. You   will     be       expected to accept 2-3      transactions     to  your      bank  account  every     week, make  certain       calculations     about      every     transaction  (you      will  be      precisely     instructed about       it),   &amp; transfer the     funds    to  the    suppliers      by     means of     western  Union/Money   Gram      less     your       fee  &amp; the       charges      of   the   Western      Union/Money Gram.      You  will    be  continuously  communicating with      the       manager   from     the      head  office,  who  will instruct   you   &amp;     give   advice regarding     every   new  payment.<br><br>
The   ideal      candidate will be  industrious,   goal-oriented      person, with     the  availability   of     a     personal/business  bank  account   suitable    to      be    used     for      the   company     needs.      Knowledge    of     English,    computer literacy    and     sociability are  appreciated.<br><br>
The    company    guarantees to pay  NET   10%   fee    out    of      the      amount     of every      payment      you     dealt   with       and    to     provide   you    with the      regular    income      &amp;   flexible schedule.  All    the related    expenses     you     might have (like  the Western      Union/Money Gram  chargers,      related    expenses      on      traveling)       are covered       by    the     company.<br><br>
