Brighthelmston emerged as an important health resort during the 18th century and
a popular destination for day trippers after the arrival of the railway in 1841.
Brighton experienced rapid population growth reaching a peak of over 160,000 by
1961. ref Carder, Timothy  1990 . The Encyclopedia of Brighton. S.127 East
Sussex County Libraries. ISBN 0 86147 315 9 /ref  Modern Brighton forms part of

History  Main article  [[History of Brighton]] In the Domesday Book, Brighton
was called Bristelmestune and a rent of 4,000 herring was established. In June
1514 Brighthelmstone was burnt to the ground by French raiders during a war
between England and France. Only part of St. Nicholas Church and the street
pattern of what is now The Lanes survived the attack. The first known drawing of
Brighthelmstone was made in 1545 and depicts what is believed to be the raid of
1514. ref Carder  1990 , s.17 /ref 

During the 1740s and 1750s, Dr Richard Russell of Lewes began prescribing the
medicinal use of the seawater at Brighton to his patients. By 1780, development
of the Regency terraces had started and the fishing village quickly became the
fashionable resort of Brighton. The growth of the town was further encouraged
following the patronage of the Prince Regent  later King George IV  after his
first visit in 1783. ref Carder  1990 , s.71 /ref  He spent much of his leisure
time in the town and constructed the exotic and expensive Royal Pavilion during
the early part of his Regency. .]]

The arrival of the railway in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day 
trippers from London and rapid population growth from around 7,000 in 1801 to
over 120,000 by 1901. ref Carder  1990 , s.127 /ref  The Victorian era saw the
building of many of the famous landmarks in Brighton including the Grand Hotel
 1864 , the West Pier  1866  and the Palace Pier  1899 .

 / /Wilson, 1811/
// The /Magnolia Warbler/, Dendroica magnolia, is a New World warbler. I

t breeds
across most of Canada as well as New England and the Great Lakes region of the
U.

S..

It is migratory, wintering in Central America. This is a very rare vagrant to
western

 Europe.

The summer male Magnolia Warbler is unmistakable. It has a blackish back and
fac

e, white supercilium and graycrown. The underparts and rump are yellow, and
there is a bla

ck breast band. The flanks are streaked with black and there is a
white wing patch.

Other

 plumages are essentially gray above and yellow below, with the flank
streaking reduced or

 absent, but there are always two white wing bars. Young
birds may have a brown back.

The

 breeding habitat is coniferous woodland. Magnolia Warblers nest in a young
conifer, layin

g 3/5 eggs in a flimsy cup nest. Both parents feed the young.

These birds feed on insects

 and spiders, often found while foraging low in
shrubs, and they will hover while tracking

 prey. They sometimes eat berries in
stormy weather, when their preferred food is scarce.



The song is a weety weety wee. The call is a soft ship.

The first bird seen by Wilson ha

ppened to be in a magnolia tree which gave this
bird its common name.
