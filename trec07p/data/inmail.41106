 Chambersburg  is a borough in Pennsylvania, United States. It is southwest of
Harrisburg in the Cumberland Valley, part of the Great Appalachian Valley. The
borough is the county seat of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. As of the 2000
census, the borough s population was 17,862.

Its settlement began in 1730 when water mills were built along the creek that
now runs through the centre of the town. Its history includes episodes related
to the French and Indian War, the Whiskey Rebellion, John Brown s raid on
Harper s Ferry, and the American Civil War.

It is located along the Lincoln Highway, US 30, between McConnellsburg,
Pennsylvania and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

History Settlement  Falling Spring  was first settled by Colonel Benjamin
Chambers, a Scots Irish immigrant, in 1730, who started a grist mill and saw
mill by a waterfall where Falling Spring Creek joined Conococheague Creek. ref

Encyclopedia Britannica, accessed 3/25/2007 /ref  The creek provided power to
the mills, and settlement was known as  Falling Spring  or  Falling Springs. 
European settlement in the area was illegal or of questionable legality until
the treaty ending the French and Indian War. The area was officially part of
Chester County, then Lancaster, and then Cumberland until it became part of the
newly established Franklin County in
1784 ref http //borough.chambersburg.pa.us/html/history.asp /ref .

the State Assembly established a formal government. The first courthouse was
John Jack s tavern on the diamond  town square  in 1784, with a permanent
courthouse built in 1793, and the first county jail built 1795. ref

3/25/2007 /ref  The  Old Jail  was built in 1818, survived the fire of 1864 and
is the oldest jail building in Pennsylvania. It was originally used as the
sheriff s residence and had the longest continuous use of any jail in the state,
operating until 1971. Today the Old Jail is a museum and home to the
Kittochtinny Historical Society of Chambersburg. ref

Chambersburg] accessed 3/25/2007 /ref  The county s gallows still stand in the
jail s courtyard.

The earliest church was established by Scots Irish Presbyterians in 1734.
Chambers gave land to the congregation in 1768, requiring only a single rose as
annual rent. Later land was given to the First Lutheran Church  1780  and Zion
Reformed Church  organized in 1780  under the same agreement, and these churches
came to be known as the  Rose Rent Churches.  ref [http //www.zionucc

community organized in 1785. The Jewish cemetery dates back to 1840.

Chambersburg was on the frontier during the French and Indian War. The area s
population dropped from about 3,000 in 1755 at the start of the war to about
300, with most settlers not returning until after 1764 when the peace treaty was
signed. ref  [http //www.rootsweb.com/ 7Epakhs/ Kittochtinny Historical Society]

/K//lauea/ is an active volcano in the Hawaiian Islands, one of five shield
 volcanoes tha

t together form the Island of Hawai//okina//i. In Hawaiian, the
 word k//lauea means /spew

ing/ or /much spreading/, in reference to the
 mountain/s frequent outpouring of lava. It 

is presently the most active volcano
 and one of the most visited active volcanoes on the 

planet. K//lauea is just
 the most recent of a long series of volcanoes that created the H

awaiian
 Archipelago, as the Pacific Plate moves over a more or less fixed hotspot in
 the

 Earth/s mantle /see, however, L////okina//ihi/.

Description K//lauea/s absolute location

 is 19.452 North, 155.292 West. It is
located on Hawaii Island, Hawaii, in the U.S. It lie

s against the southeast
flank of much larger /[[Mauna Loa]]/ volcano. Mauna Loa/s massive 

size and
elevation /13,677 feet or 4,169 m/ is a stark contrast to K//lauea, which rises
o

nly 4,091 feet /1,247 m/ above sea level, and thus from the summit caldera
appears as a br

oad shelf of uplands well beneath the long profile of
occasionally snow/capped Mauna Loa, 

15 miles /24 km/ distant.

First/time visitors to K//lauea, not familiar with how differen

t the profile of
a shield volcano can be compared with stratovolcanoes like Mt. Fuji, Moun

t Hood,
and Mount St. Helens, are usually unaware they are approaching the summit of an
ac

tive volcano as they make the drive up through the cloud forest on State Rte.

/okina//i Volcanoes National Park from Hilo/mdash/or coming from Kailua/

heads south to Kea//okina//au,

 then turns abruptly westward to begin the climb
to the K//lauea caldera. For some 20 mile

s /32 km/ the road runs relatively
straight, making a 4,000 ft /1,200 m/ ascent. However, 

most of this climb is
actually on the heavily vegetated flank of Mauna Loa/ the crossing o

nto lava
flows issued from K//lauea is about 1 mile west of Glenwood, 18 miles /29 km/
fro

m Hilo. The Mauna Loa flows are several thousand years old/ the lightly
vegetated K//lauea

 flows are only 350 to 500 years old.

Driving from the Kona Coast, the immense size 

of the Big Island becomes
apparent/ from Kailua/Kona it is 98 miles /158 km/ on the M//mal

ahoa Highway
/State Rte. 11/ to K//lauea. After passing around the southern end of Mauna L

oa,
the highway turns northeastward towards K//lauea once past the town of
N////okina////l

ehu. Yet, as from the Hilo side, the long climb from near sea
level to the summit is all o

n the flank of Mauna Loa. Not until the Sulfur Bank
scarp /the northwestern edge of K//lau

ea Caldera/, near the intersection of
Crater Rim Drive in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, 

does the road cross over
onto K//lauea. However, the highway parallels the line of contact

 between the
two volcanoes/mdash/always less than 1 mile to the southeast/mdash/from the
v

icinity of Punaluu at the coast to the caldera at the summit.

Ka//okina//// The highway r

oute from the west /State Rte. 11/ is vastly
different from that seen when coming from Hil

o. The highway approaches K//lauea
through a desert on the leeward slope called Ka//okina/

///. K//lauea/s height of
4000 ft is sufficient to force most of the moisture out of the i

mpinging
Northwest Trades, leaving Ka// in the rain shadow of the /low/ mountain. This
are

a is also the very active southwest rift zone of K//lauea, a prolific ash
producer. Winds 

redistribute the ash, causing dust storms and dunes barren of
most vegetation.

K//lauea C

aldera and Halema//okina//uma//okina//u Crater


Hawaii Volcanoes National Park encompasse

s a portion of K//lauea, and the park
visitor center is located near the margin of the sum

mit caldera, overlooking a
large pit crater called /Halema//okina//uma//okina//u/. The rou

ghly circular
caldera measures 3x5 km /or 6x6 km, including the outermost ring faults/.

K

//lauea eruptions


Eruptions at K//lauea occur primarily either from the summit caldera o

r along
either of the lengthy East and Southwest rift zones that extend from the caldera
t

o the sea. In recent decades, eruptions have been continuous, with many of the
lava flows 

reaching to the Pacific Ocean shore. About 90/ of the surface of
K//lauea is lava flows le

ss than 1,100 years old/ 70/ of the surface is younger
than 600 years.

There were 45 erup

tions of K//lauea in the twentieth century. The Mauna Ulu
eruption of K//lauea began on Ma

y 24, 1969 and ended on July 22, 1974. At the
time, Mauna Ulu was the longest flank erupti

on of any Hawaiian volcano in
recorded history. The eruption created a new vent, covered m

assive amounts of
land with lava, and added new land to the island.


The Mauna Ulu erupti

on first started as a fissure between two pit craters,
//okina////lo//okina//i and //okina

//Alae, where the Mauna Ulu shield would
eventually form. Both p//hoehoe and //okina//a//o

kina//// lava erupted from the
volcano. Early on, fountains of lava burst out as much as 5

40 meters high. In
early 1973, an earthquake occurred that caused K//lauea to stop eruptin

g near
the original Mauna Ulu site and instead erupt near the craters Pauahi and
Hi//okina

//iaka. However, the eruption site soon returned to normal. The 1990
lava flow in particul

ar was notable for being destructive of property.

The current K//lauea eruption began in 

January 1983 along the East rift zone
from Pu//okina//u //okina//////
