The  lion   Panthera leo  is a mammal of the family Felidae and one of four  big
cats  in the genus [[Panthera]]. The lion is the second largest feline species,
after the tiger. The male lion, easily recognized by his mane, weighs between
150 ndash 250 nbsp kg  330   500 nbsp lb . Females range 120 ndash 150 nbsp kg
 260   330 nbsp lb . ref  /ref  In the wild, lions live for around 10   14
years, while in captivity they can live over 20 years. Though they were once
found throughout much of Africa, Asia and Europe, lions presently exist in the
wild only in Africa and India. They enjoy hot climates, and hunt in groups.

Population and distribution
s. Plans are afoot to re introduce some to Palpur Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in the
   neighboring State of Madhya Pradesh in India.]]

In relatively recent times the habitat of lions spanned the southern parts of
Eurasia, ranging from Portugal to India, and most of Africa except the central
rainforest zone and the Sahara desert. The last lions in Europe died out in
historic times. In the Caucasus, their last European outpost, a population of
the Asiatic lion survived until the 10th century. Between the late 19th and
early 20th century they also became extinct in North Africa and the Middle East.
Now, most lions live in eastern and southern Africa, and their numbers are
rapidly decreasing. Currently, estimates of the African lion population range
between 16,000 and 30,000 living in the wild, down from early 1990s estimates
that ranged as high as 100,000  increased contact with human development is
cited as the primary cause
[http //www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/vanishinglions/index.html]. The remaining
populations are often geographically isolated from each other, which can lead to
inbreeding, and consequently, a lack of genetic diversity.

The Asiatic Lion  Panthera leo persica , which in historical times ranged from
Turkey to India and from the Caucasus to Yemen, was eradicated from Palestine by
the Middle Ages and from most of the rest of Asia after the arrival of readily
available firearms in the 18th century. In Iran the last lion was shot in 1942.
The subspecies now survives only in and around the Gir Forest of northwestern
India. About 300 lions live in a 1412 km    558 square miles  sanctuary in the
state of Gujarat, which covers most of the forest. Their numbers remain stable.
Until the late Pleistocene, lions were also found in the Americas and in
northern Eurasia. The most famous of these prehistoric subspecies were the Cave
Lion  Panthera leo spelaea  and the American Lion  Panthera leo atrox   not to
be confused with the Cougar, Puma concolor, also known as the Mountain Lion . It
should be noted, however, that both American and Cave lions have been recently
considered to be separate species, closely related to lions but not belonging to
the same species. Genetic studies have confirmed this.

Diet and hunting fight for prey]] ]] ]]

Female lions usually hunt at night or dawn and in packs. Their prey consists
mainly of large mammals, such as antelopes, gazelles, warthogs, wildebeest,
buffalos and zebras, but smaller animals like hares and birds are also taken
occasionally. Carrion is readily taken and often recovered from other predators
like hyenas and wild dogs. In some areas, lions specialise on rather atypical
prey species  this is the case at the Savuti river, where they constantly prey
on young elephants, and at the Linyanti, where they hunt hippos  both rivers are
in Chobe National Park, Botswana . It is reported that the lions, driven by
extreme hunger, started taking down baby elephants, then moved on to adolescents
and occasionally fully grown adults. ref [http //www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20547955 
38195,00.html] /ref .

Young lions first try hunting at three months old, but are often not successful
hunters until they are two years old. Lions can reach speeds of 50
mph ref http //www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004737.html /ref , but they lack the
endurance to be long distance runners, so they have to come quite close to their
prey before starting the attack. They sneak up to the victim until they reach a
distance of about 30 m  98 feet  or less. Usually several lions work together
and encircle the herd from different points. The attack is short and powerful,
and the lion tries to catch the victim with a fast rush and some final leaps.
The prey is usually killed by strangulation. ref http //www.african 
lion.org/lions_e.htm /ref  re</STYLE>

/Calvin College/ is 

a comprehensive liberal arts college located in Grand
Rapids, Michigan. Founded in 1876, C

alvin College is an educational institution
of the Christian Reformed Church and stands in

 the Reformed tradition of
Protestantism. Calvin College is named after Jean Chauvin, or C

auvin /John
Calvin/, the 16th century Reformer at the center of the Reformation movement.



History

The college and Calvin Theological Seminary were formed by the Christian
Reforme

d Church for the purpose of training church ministers, with seven
students enrolled in the

 first year. The initial six/year curriculum included
four years in the Literary departmen

t and two years in the Theological
department. In 1894 students who were not pre/theologic

al students were admitted
to an expanded curriculum, and thus the school became a type of 

preparatory
school or academy. In 1900 the curriculum was further broadened and made more


attractive to students interested in teaching or in preparing for
preprofessional courses 

in the universities.

By 1906 the Literary Department, which provided the four years of pr

eparatory
and two years of college work, became known officially as the John Calvin Junior


College. The two/year college in time became a four/year college, and the
preparatory dep

artment was discontinued. In 1917 the college established a
campus on Franklin Street in G

rand Rapids, where it remained until the 1960s.
The first Bachelor of Arts degree from Cal

vin College was awarded in 1921.


Although the school grew slowly in its early years, by 

1930 it had reached its
pre/World War II size of 350/450 students. By 1950 the enrollment 

had climbed to
1,270. Over the years from 1962/1973, the college migrated to a larger camp

us.
Built on the site of the Knollcrest farm in southeast Grand Rapids, the new
location i

ncreased Calvin/s campus from approximately one large city block to
390 acres with a 100 a

cre nature preserve. During the latter decades of the 20th
century, Calvin grew to over 40

00 students, where the enrollment has remained
since. The college contains 7 residence hal

ls/ Boer/Bennink Hall, Beets/Veenstra
Hall, Bolt/Heyns/Timmer Hall, Kalsbeek/Huizenga Hall

, Noordewier/Vander Werp
Hall, Rooks/Van Dellen Hall, and Schultze/Eldersveld Hall.

The c

urriculum has expanded to include professional training in a variety of
fields, but the co

llege maintains a strong commitment to a liberal arts
curriculum, which the college views 

as a means to develop students/
understanding of God/s world and their place in it.

The s

chool made national headlines in 2005 when US President George W. Bush
served as commencem

ent
speaker[http///www.calvin.edu/commencement/2005/reflections.htm]. While most of
the co

mmunity was supportive, a significant number of faculty and students
protested his speakin

g//some in opposition to the administration/s policies,
while others were concerned over t

he politicization of the event. Some protested
by wearing stickers with the phrase /God is

 not a Republican ... or a Democrat/
to the commencement. This has given Calvin a reputati

on for having more liberal
students and faculty than most evangelical colleges.

Population and distribution
s. Plan< are a/>foot to re <introdu/>ce some to Palpur Kuno Wil<dlife Sanctuary in the
   nei/>ghboring State o< Madhya Pradesh in India.]]

In relat/>ively recent times the habitat of <lions spann/>ed the southern parts< of
E/>Eurasia, ran<ing from Portugal to India, and most /> of Africa exc<pt the central/>
rainforest zone and the Sahara desert. <The last lions in Eur/>r<ope died out in
historic times. In the />C<ucasus, their last European outpost/>t, a population of
the A<siatic lion survived until the 10th c/>century. Between t<he late 19th and
early 20th century/> they a<lso became /> extinct <n North Africa and /> the Middle East.
Now, most lions< live in e/>astern and southern< Africa, a/>and their numbers a<e
rapidly dec/>creasing. Currentl<, esti/>imates of the African l<on populatio/>n range
between 16,000 and 30<,000 living in the wild, down from ear/>rl< 1990s e/>estim<t/>tes
t<hat ranged as high as 100,000  increased/> contact with h<man dev/>velo<pment is
cited as the primary/>y cause
[htt<p //www.pbs/>.org/wnet/nature/vanishingl<ons/index.html]. The remaining
/>
populations are often ge<graphically isolated from each othe/>er, which can lead to
inbreeding, and co<sequentl/>ly, a lack of genetic di<ersity.

The Asiatic Lion  P/>Panthera leo persica , which in<historic/>cal ti<mes ranged from
Turkey to India and fr/>rom <he Caucasus to Yemen, was er/>adicated from Palestine by
the Mi<ddle Ages and from most of the rest o/>f Asia after the arrival of re<adily
available firearms in the/> 18th cent<ury. In Iran th/>he last lion was shot in <1942.
The subspecies now survives/> only in and a<ound the Gir Forest of northwestern
Indi/>ia. About 300 lions live in a 141< km    558 square mile/>s  san<tuary in the
state of Gujarat, which c/>c<vers most of the forest./>. Their numbers remain <table.
Until the late /> Plei<stocene, lions were also found in the />Americas and in
north<ern Eurasia. Th/>e most famous of <hese prehistoric su/>ubspecies were the C<ve
Lion  Pant/>hera< leo spelaea  and the American Lion  /> Panthera leo atrox   not to
be confus<ed with th/>e Cougar, Puma concolor, als<o known />as the <Mountain Lion . It
should be noted/>, however, that <oth A/>American and Cave lions have been recent<y
considered to be separate specie/>es, closely related to lions <ut not be/>longing to
the same species. Genetic <studies have confirmed this.

D/>iet and hunting <ight for prey]] ]] ]]

Female lions us/>sually hunt at night or dawn a<d in packs. Their prey co/>nsists
mainly of lar<ge mammals, such /> as antel<pes, gazelles, warthog/>s<, wildebeest,
buffalos and zeb/>bras, bu<t s/>maller an<mals like hares and birds are also ta/>aken
occasionally. Carrion is re<dily taken and often recovere/>ed from other predators
li<e hye/>enas and wild dogs. In some <reas, lions specialise on rather atyp/>pical
prey species  this is the case at< the Savuti river, wher/>e they constantly prey
on young e<lephants, and at the Linyant/>ti, where th<y hunt hippos  both r/>rivers are
in Chobe National <ark, Botswana . It/>t is reported that the<lions, driven by/>y
extrem< hunger, started taking down baby/>y elephants, then moved on to adolescen<ts
and />occasionally fully grown adults<. re/>f [http //www.news.com.au/stor<y/0,23599,20547955 
38195,00.html] /re/>f .

Young lions first try h<unting at three months/>s old, but are ofte< not successful
/>hu<ters until they are two /> years old. Lions can reach speeds of<50
mph ref http //www./>.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004737.ht<l /ref , but t/>they <lack the
endurance to be long distance r/>runners,<so t/>they have to come qui<e close to their
prey before st/>arting the attack. They sneak up <o the victim until they reach a
distanc/>ce of about <30 />m  9< feet  or less. Usually s/>several lions work to<gether
and encircle the />herd from different points. The< attack/> is shor<t and powerful,
and the/> lion<tries to catch the victim with a f/>fast rush and some final le<aps.
The prey is usually killed/>d by strangulati<n. ref http //www.african
