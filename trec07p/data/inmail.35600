Dear Beloved,
After going through your profile i decided to contact you for friendship,
assistance and distribution of my inheritance.
My name is Rosemary Everson,i am a dying woman who has decided to donate
What i have to you/church.
I am 59 years old,was diagnosed of cancer about 2 years ago immediately after
The death of my husband,who has left me everything he worked for.
I have been touched by God to donate from what i have inherited from my late
Husband to you for the good work of God,rather than to allow my relatives to 
Use my husbands hard earned funds ungodly.
Please pray that the good Lord forgive me my sins.I have asked God to forgive 
Me and i know he has because he is a merciful God.I will be going for an 
Operation in less than one hour.
I decided to WILL/donatethe sum of 2,000,000 Euros(Two million Euros)to you
For the good work of the Lord,and also to help the motherless,less priviledged
And assistance of the Widows.
I cannot take any telephone calls at the moment  due to the fact that my relatives
Are around me and my health status.
I have adjusted my WILL and my lawyer is aware that i have changed my WILL,you and my lawyer will arrange the transfer of the funds from my account
To yours.
I wish you all the best and may the good Lord bless you abundantly,and please
Use the funds well and always extend the good work to others.
Contact my lawyer (Barrister.Frederick Peterson) with this specified 
Email:fedpeters07@aim.com and tell him that i have WILLED 2,000,000 Euros
To you,i have also notified him that i am WILLING that amount to you for a 
Specific and good work.I know that i don’t know you but i have been directed to
Do this.Thanks and Godbless you.
N.B:I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the task is accomplished as i don’t want anything to jeopardize my last wish.I shall try my possible best to contact you via email as i don't want my relatives or anybody to
Know because they are around me.
Regards,
Mrs.Rosemary Everson.
Happy moments,praise God
Difficult moments,seek God
Quiet moments,worship God
Painful moments,trust God
Every moment,thank God.
