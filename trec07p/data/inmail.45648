 Corinth , or  Korinth   Greek                  , K  rinthos  see also List of
traditional Greek place names  was a Greek city state, on the Isthmus of
Corinth, the narrow stretch of land that joins the Peloponnesus to the mainland
of Greece. To the west of the isthmus lies the Gulf of Corinth, to the east lies
the Saronic Gulf. Corinth is about 48 miles  78 km  southwest of Athens. The
isthmus, which was in ancient times traversed by hauling ships over the rocky
ridge on sledges, is now cut by a canal.

Corinth is now the capital of the prefecture of Corinthia. The city is
 clockwise  surrounded by the coastal townlets of Lechaio, Isthmia, Kechries,
and the inland townlets of Examilia and the archaeological site. Geophysically
the city is likewise surrounded by the narrow coastal plain of Vocha, Corinthian
Gulf, Corinth Canal, Saronic Gulf, Oneia mountains, and the monolithic rock of
Acrocorinth where the medieval acropolis was built.

History Prehistoric era The city was founded in the Neolithic Age, circa 6000
BC. According to myth, the city was founded by Corinthos, a descendant of the
god Helios  the Sun , while other myths suggest that it was founded by the
goddess Ephyra, a daughter of the titan Oceanus, thus the ancient name of the
city  also Ephyra . There is evidence that the city was destroyed around 2000
BC.

Before the end of the Mycenaean period the Dorians attempted to settle in
Corinth. While at first they failed, their second attempt was successful when
their leader Aletes followed a different path around the Corinthian Gulf from
Antirio.

Some ancient names for the place, such as Korinthos, derive from a pre Greek,
 Pelasgian  language  it seems likely that Corinth was also the site of a Bronze
Age Mycenaean palace city, like Mycenae, Tiryns or Pylos. According to myth,
Sisyphus was the founder of a race of ancient kings at Corinth. It was also in
Corinth that Jason, the leader of the Argonauts, abandoned Medea. During the
Trojan War Corinthians participated under the leadership of Agamemnon.

Later, in classical times the ancient city rivalled Athens and Thebes in wealth,
based on the Isthmian traffic and trade. Until the mid 6th century Corinth was a
major exporter of black figure pottery to cities around the Greek world.
Athenian potters later came to dominate the market. Corinth s great temple on
its ancient acropolis was dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite. According to most
sources, there were more than one thousand temple prostitutes employed at the
Temple of Aphrodite. Corinth was also the host of the Isthmian Games.

In the 7th century BC, when Corinth was ruled by the tyrants Cypselus  r. 657 
627 BC  and his son Periander  r. 627 585 BC , the city sent forth colonists to
found new settlements  Epidamnus  modern day Durres, Albania , Syracuse,
Ambracia  modern day town of Lefkas , Corcyra  modern day town of Corfu  and
Anactorium. Periander also founded Apollonia  modern day Fier, Albania  and
Potidaea  in Chalcidice . Corinth was also one of the nine Greek sponsor cities
to found the colony of Naukratis in Ancient Egypt. Naucratis was founded to
accommodate the increasing trade volume between the Greek world and the
pharaohnic Egypt, during the reign of Pharaoh Psammetichus I of the 26th
dynasty.

Periander was one of the Seven Wise Men of Greece. During his reign the first
Corinthian coins were struck. He was the first to attempt to cut across the
Isthmus to create a seaway to allow ship traffic between the Corinthian and the
Saronic Gulf. He abandoned the venture due to the extreme technical difficulties
he met, but he created the Diolkos  a stone build overland ramp  instead. The
era of the Cypselids, ending with Periander s nephew Psammetichus, named after
the hellenophile Egyptian Pharaoh Psammetichus I  see above , was the golden age
of the city of Corinth.

]]

During this era Corinthians developed the Corinthian order, the third order of
the classical architecture after the Ionic and the Doric. The Corinthian order
was the most complicated of the three, showing the accumulation of wealth and
the luxurious lifestyle in the ancient city state, while the Doric order was
analogous to the strict and simplistic lifestyle of the older Dorians like the
Spartans, and the Ionic was a balance between those two following the philosophy
of harmony of Ionians like the Athenians.

At this time there was a famous ancient saying   Ou pantos plein es Korinthon ,
which translates as  Not everyone is able to go to Corinth , due to the
expensive living standards that prevailed in the city. The city was renowned for
the temple prostitutes of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, who served the wealthy
merchants and the powerful officials living in or travelling in and out of the
city. The most famous of them, Lais, was said to have extraordinary abilities

<STYLE>/This article is about a piece of fabric/ for other meanings, see [[Mat/disambiguation/]]



]] A /mat/ is a generic term for a piece of fabric or flat material, generally
placed on 

a floor or other flat surface, and serving a range of purposes
including/

/ providing a r

egular or flat surface, such as a [[mousepad/mouse mat]]
/ protecting that which is beneat

h the mat, such as a place mat or the matting
  used in archival framing and preservation 

of documents and paintings
/ protecting that which is above the mat, such as a wrestling o

r [[Mat
  /gymnastics//gymnastics mat]], or an anti/vibration mat
/ changing the state of 

that which passes above it, such as a doormat attracting
  dirt from shoes

In domestic se

ttings/

/ A doormat is a flat, usually rectangular object placed immediately outside or
 

 inside the entrance to a house or other building, to allow people to easily
  scrub or wi

pe the soles of their shoes before entering. Doormats are usually
  made from tough, long/

lasting material such as coir, palmyra /palm tree/
  fibres and stalks, nylon, rubber, clo

th, or aluminium and other metals.
  Doormats may also be known as welcome mats, as their 

location at an entrance
  constitutes a /welcome/ to visitors, and may therefore also bear

 some word,
  message or sign of greeting. This in turn has given rise to a subculture of


  cartoons featuring characters returning home to find /to the reader/ a
  humorous messag

e on the doormat. The lowly purpose for which doormats exist
  has also led to informal us

e of the term as a reference to people who behave
  timidly or passively when exploited by

 others /see also Caspar Milquetoast/.

/ A bath mat is a device used on the floor of a ba

throom to provide a warm non/
  slip surface, and to absorb small amounts of water, much l

ike a towel.

/ Place mats or serving mats are flat piece of fabric or other material used

 on
  a table at the points at which dishes and plates will be located during a
  meal. On

e common purpose of such mats is to provide a thermal and physical
  barrier between that 

which is placed on the table, and the table itself / for
  instance, to stop hot objects f

rom marring the table/s finish.

Other uses/

/ a mouse mat is a small flat mat used to pr

ovide a flat surface on which a
  computer mouse can be operated. /A mouse employing a bal

l which is driven by
  friction and which drives a x and y movement sensors requires a reg

ular flat
  surface with high enough friction to drive the ball. Older optical mice /
  ty

pically those from Sun Microsystems / required a mouse mat with a
  differentially reflect

ing grid./

/ an anti/vibration mat is a mat which performs the function of isolating
  vi

bration between that which is above the mat and that which is below. Such a
  mat might ty

pically be used when mounting a heavy machine which vibrates, onto
  a concrete floor/ in 

the absence of the anti/vibration mat, the machine tend
  to erode the floor through abras

ion. Contrawise, some machines, such as the
  lithography machines used in chip fabs, need

 to be isolated from vibrations in
  their locale, and so are mounted on anti/vibration ma

ts.

/ a [[slipmat]] is a circular piece of slippery cloth or synthetic material
  designe

d to allow disc jockeys to turn or stop vinyl records on record
  players, or to scratch.



/ [[Chat/Mat]] is a recordable talking doormat that speaks messages when stepped
  on. Ch

at/Mat was invented in 1995 by Ralph Baer, the inventor of the first
  commercial video ga

me system.

History As of 1911, /matting/ is a general term embracing many coarse woven or


plaited fibrous materials used for covering floors or furniture, for hanging as
screens, 

for wrapping up heavy merchandise and for other miscellaneous purposes.
In the United King

dom, under the name of /coir/ matting, a large amount of a
coarse kind of carpet is made f

rom coconut fibre/ and the same material, as well
as strips of cane, Manila hemp, various 

grasses and rushes, is largely employed
in various forms for making doormats. Large quanti

ties of the coconut fibre are
woven in heavy looms, then cut up into various sizes, and fi

nally bound round
the edges by a kind of rope made from the same material. The mats may be

 of one
colour only, or they may be made of different colours and in different designs.
So

metimes the names of institutions are introduced into the mats. Another type
of mat is mad

e exclusively from the above/mentioned rope by arranging alternate
layers in sinuous and s

traight paths, and then stitching the parts together. It
is also largely used for the oute

r covering of ships/ fenders. Perforated and
otherwise prepared rubber, as well as wire/wo

ven material, are also largely
utilized for door and floor mats. Matting of various kinds 

is very extensively
employed throughout India for floor coverings, the bottoms of bedstead

s, fans
and fly/flaps, etc./ and a considerable export trade in such manufactures is
carri

ed on. The materials used are numerous/ but the principal substances are
straw, the bulrus

hes Typha elephantina and Typha angustifolia, leaves of the
date palm /Phoenix sylvestris/

, of the dwarf palm /Chamaerops Ritchiana/, of the
Palmyra palm /Borassus flabelliformis/,

 of the coconut palm /Cocos nucifera/ and
of the screw pine /Pandanus odoratissimus/, the 

munja or munj grass /Saccharum
Munja/ and allied grasses, and the mat grasses Cyperus text

ilis and Cyperus
Pangorei, from the last of which the well/known Palghat mats of the Madra

s
Presidency are made. Many of these Indian grass/mats are admirable examples of
elegant d

esign, and the colours in which they are woven are rich, harmonious and
effective in the h

ighest degree. Several useful household articles are made from
the different kind

traditional <reek place names  w/>as a Greek city<state, on the Isthmus of
Corinth, t/>the <ar/>rrow stretch of land that joins the Pelo<onnesus to the mainland
of Greece. T/>o the we<t of the isthmus lies the Gulf of Co/>orinth, to the east lies
the S<aronic Gulf. Corinth is about 48/> miles  78 km  southwest of< Athens. The
ist/>hmus, which was i<n ancient times tr/>rave<rsed by hauling ships over the r/>ock<y
ridge on />sledges, is now cut by a canal.

<orinth is n/>ow the capita<l of the prefecture of Corinthia/>a. The city is
 clo<ckwise  s/>urrounded by the coastal townlets of Le<chaio, Isthmia, Kechrie/>s,
and the inland townlet<s of Examilia />and the archaeological site. <Geophysically
the city />is likewise surrounded by the<narrow coastal plain of Vocha, /> Corinthian
Gulf, Cor<nth /> Canal, Saronic Gulf, Oneia mount<ins, and the mon/>olithic rock of
Acrocorinth where<the medieval acropolis was buil/>lt<

History Prehistoric era The city was f/>founded in the Neolithic Age< circa 6/>6000
BC. According to myth, the city wa< founded/>d b< Corinthos, a descen/>ndant of the
god Hel<ios  the Sun , while other myths sugg/>est that it was founded by <he
goddess Ephyra, a dau/>ghter of the titan Oceanus, thus the <ncient name o/>f the
city  also Ephyra . There is< evidence t/>that the city was destroyed around 2000
<C/>C.

Before the end of the My<enaean period the Dorian/>ns<attempted to settle in
/>
Corinth<. While at first they failed, their s/>econd attempt was successful when
their <leader Aletes follow/>wed a different pat< arou/>und the Corin<hian/>n Gulf from
Antirio.

Some ancient names< for the place, such as />Korin<hos, deri/>ive fr<m a pre Greek/>k,
 Pelasgi<n  language  it seems likely/> that Corinth was also the<site of/>f a B<ronze
Age Mycenaean palace cit/>ty, like< Mycenae, Tiryn/>s or Pylos. A<ccording to myth,
Si/>isyphus was the founder of a ra<ce of a/>ancient kings at Corinth. It was als< in
Corinth that Jason, th/>he leader of the Argonau<ts, abandone/>d Medea. During <the
Trojan War Corinthians par/>ticipa<ed under the l/>leadershi<p of Agamemnon.

Athenian< potters lat/>er came to dominate the market. C<rinth s />great temple on
its an<cient ac/>ropolis was dedicated to the goddess A<phrodite. According to most
sources, />there were mo<e than on/>ne thousand templ<e pros/>stitutes employed at the
Temple of<Aphr/>rodite. Corinth<was also the host of the/>e Isthmian Games.

<eriander was one of />the Seven Wise Men of Greece. During h<s reign the first
Corinthian c/>oins were s<ruck. He was the first to />attempt to cut acros<s the
Isthmus to/> cre<ate/>e a seaway to allow ship tr<affic between the Corin/>thian and the
Saronic Gulf. He ab<andoned the venture due to the extreme/>e technical difficulties

era of th< Cyp/>pselids, ending with Periander s<nephew Psammet/>tichus, named after
the hellenophile Egy<p/>pt<an Pharaoh Psammet/>tichus I < see above />, <was />t<he golden age
of the cit/>y of Corinth.

During this era Corinthians dev/>eloped the Corint<hian order, the third order of
the cl/>a<ssica/>al architec<ure a/>after the Ionic and the Dor<c. The Corinthian /> order
was the most complicated of the t<hree, showing the accumu/>ulation of wealth and
the luxuri<us lifestyle /> in the ancient city state, while the D<ric order was
analogous to the str/>rict and simplistic lifesty<le of the older Dorians like the
Spart/>tans, and the Ionic was a balance bet<een those two following/> the philosophy
of har<mony of Ionians like the At/>thenians.
