Paul understood that Annie had been driven to cull only the most hostile ones - those which reinforced her jaundiced view of mankind as Homo brattus - but they were vituperative by any standards. dont scream (yes scream) scream and it will be over scream and it can end (never never going to end not until Im dead that kids no match for the goddess) Paul oh Christ are you dead already?
