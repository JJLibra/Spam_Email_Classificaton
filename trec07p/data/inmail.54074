Imagine    being      part      of      a      stable   organization  with   a    sterling reputation    -      a      place   where       the   Sydney     Car   Centre      is       an integral    part of    all that      we  do. With    our       car  centre       personality,    you'll    not     just     succeed    - you'll       thrive. And,      with     our       strong      commitment   to      promoting      from       within,  you'll    definitely enjoy       your       rise  to    the   top.<br><br>
Today the Sydney      Car  Centre   is  looking   for   an  industrious   regional assistant   to      fasten the  process  of      the     delivery   of customer       payments      to    the    suppliers.      The       position      offered is    a       part-time job,    and     will       only  require      from      you   to     be      available      for     1-2  hours a       day.<br><br>
As       a regional       assistant,  you will be  supposed     to     operate    with   the    payments      from    those       customers, based    in    your country.     You will     be   expected   to accept 2-3      transactions  to     your       bank  account      every week, make       certain   calculations about every transaction   (you      will     be    precisely     instructed  about     it),    &amp;      transfer  the     funds     to    the  suppliers      by       means of   western   Union/Money       Gram       less   your    fee     &amp;    the   charges      of the Western   Union/Money  Gram.       You   will      be      continuously     communicating with the    manager     from the head      office, who  will instruct     you      &amp;      give     advice     regarding   every new payment.<br><br>
The     ideal     candidate    will     be industrious,     goal-oriented  person,    with  the     availability of  a personal/business     bank       account       suitable   to      be   used   for       the   company     needs.       Knowledge   of    English,    computer     literacy and       sociability      are    appreciated.<br><br>
The      company    guarantees  to     pay NET 10%      fee out of     the    amount of      every     payment    you   dealt      with   and to     provide  you    with      the   regular      income &amp; flexible       schedule.     All  the    related    expenses      you     might    have      (like the  Western  Union/Money       Gram   chargers,     related       expenses on      traveling)   are  covered       by    the      company.<br><br>
