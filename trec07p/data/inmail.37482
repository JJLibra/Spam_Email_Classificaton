<=21--And when a tight game came down to the final minutes, Derek Fisher upstaged the Warri=
ors with a shooting show of his own that put the businesslike Jazz on the edge of an unlikely s=
tage: the Western Conference finals.

Carlos Boozer had 34 points and 12 rebounds and the Jazz handed the eighth-seeded Warriors=
 their first home loss of the postseason, 115-101 on Sunday to put Utah up 3-1 in their second=
-round playoff series.

Fisher scored 14 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter for the surprising Jazz, who hadn't b=
een to the playoffs since the Stockton-to-Malone era ended in 2003. Utah won the Northwest=
 Division title this season, but is learning the playoff game on the fly.

The Warriors had another golden mass of fans =E2=80=94 but the Jazz had more brass.

=22That was a big step in the growth process for us as a team,=22 said Fisher, who missed the s=
eries opener and dramatically returned during Game 2 after tending to his daughter's seri=
ous health problem.

=22It was like we knew what to expect. It was a great atmosphere to play in, but we handled it l=
ike pros.=22

With a poised, gritty performance that should have made the former Jazz greats proud, Utah=
 earned the chance to clinch its first trip to the conference finals since 1998 with a victor=
y at home in Game 5 on Tuesday night, ending the Warriors' improbable run of playoff excitem=
ent.

Deron Williams had 20 points and 13 assists as the Jazz finally solved the riddle of Oracle A=
rena, where the underdog Warriors won their first four playoff home games with uptempo off=
ense and fan support that dazzled the nation.

But with a Jerry Sloan game plan that hearkened back to those bruising days when Karl Malone=
 and John Stockton ruled the West, Utah simply bullied Golden State.

=22We're doing better staying with what they're trying to take away from us,=22 Sloan said=
=2E =22Our team hasn't had to make these adjustments, but our guys are getting better and bett=
er.=22

Al Harrington scored 24 points before fouling out, but Baron Davis had just 15 points and se=
ven assists. The Warriors were a dissonant mess through most of their first home loss in 10 g=
ames dating to the regular season =E2=80=94 yet they still held a lead in the final minutes b=
efore Utah's superior poise won it again.

Sleepy Floyd had his 51-point playoff game for the Warriors against the        Los Angeles Lakers=
 on Mother's Day 20 years ago, but Davis had no such heroics left. The Warriors' leader went 6=
-for-16, including 2-of-8 on 3-pointers.
