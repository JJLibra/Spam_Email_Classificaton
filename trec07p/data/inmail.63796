One of the key elements in the incentive programs is a solar "feed-in" tariff that pays people and organizations with solar panels cash for any electricity they feed into the grid. In the United States, utilities offer credits for solar power; a homeowner or business can reduce their electricity bill with these credits, but at best end up owing nothing to the utility. 

Dell seems to be really taking the whole ‘apology’ thing to the next level though. Recently, an ex-Dell salesman – not disgruntled either - posted up 22 things that would help you get the best deal from doing business with Dell. It appeared on The Consumerist Web site. This was duly followed by numerous legal takedown letters from Dell’s legal bulls. Duly ignored, the 22 tips travelled the Web and Net users (many Dell customers included) lashed back at the company for being so heavy-handed.

Hi Mike, 

Mycelo 

Open Office is the way to go. I support the ODF file format and so does the International Standards Organization.

WE HAVE RECEIVED a picture of a 3DMark score from a system running the late and upcoming ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT card. This board was planned to cost around $80, but in reality, you can expect prices to be way lower.  Barbu  To achieve this, the team had to carry out a delicate balancing act. Smaller spheres convert more radiation to heat, which makes them better at destroying tumours, but larger ones scatter more radiation, which is vital for the imaging stage. Previously, the spheres were 120 nanometres in diameter, which meant they only scattered 15 per cent of the light shone on them, and converted the rest to heat. West's team increased their size to 140 nanometres, causing them to convert 67 per cent of the light to heat, and to scatter the remaining 33 per cent.

In the old days, the fanboys would have had to create their own webpage about their favourite spaceship captains, but these days they can just create a wacky entry and pretend it is of some social importance. I am sure they really feel that they are contributing greatly to the knowledge of civilisation by documenting every single episode of Simpsons. 
Our total labor and sheetrock costs were around $4,000, with an additional $3,000 for materials. (We also invested $1,000 to have fiberglass insulation pumped into our walls to give the apartment a smidgen of sound isolation before the real work began.)

In this curious form of aphasia, the subject is unable to distinguish between a discussion and a contest. The subject approaches any online forum as a sort of playing field, and attempts to "win" the discussion by any means necessary. The rules of the imaginary contest are apparently clear to the individual as he or she will often point out when others break them, but when asked to outline these rules the individual is reluctant, perhaps not wishing to confer an "advantage" on any "opponents." The conditions for winning are similarly difficult to pin down, although in some cases the individual will declare himself the winner of a discussion that, to all others, appears to be ongoing. 

The censors decided yesterday that Manhunt 2, which tells the heart rending tale of an insane asylum escapee who kills enemies in gruesome ways, had no redeeming features and banned it.
Noise problems are typically complex and multifaceted, and as our acoustic consultant told us, sound is like water: block it from traveling along one path, and it will simply find another.
