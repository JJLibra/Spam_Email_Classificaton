 Parachuting,  or  skydiving,  is an activity involving the a free fall from a
height using a parachute.

The history of skydiving began with a descent from a balloon by Andr   Jacques
Garnerin in 1797. Skydiving has been used by the military since the early 1900s,
including use in World War I and World War II. Early competitions date back to
the 1930s, and it became an international sport in 1951.

Today it is performed as a recreational activity and a competitive sport, as
well as for the deployment of military personnel and occasionally forest
firefighters.


Procedure Typically, a trained skydiver  or jumper  and a group of associates
meet at an isolated airport. A fixed base operator at that airport usually
operates one or more light cargo aircraft, and takes groups of skydivers up for
a fee. In the earlier days of the sport, it was common for an individual jumper
to go up in a Beech 18 or Spielas DC 3 aircraft for reasons of economy.

A typical jump involves individuals jumping out of aircraft  usually an
airplane, but sometimes a helicopter or even the gondola of a balloon ,
travelling at approximately 4000 metres  around 13,000 nbsp feet  altitude, and
free falling for a period of time before activating a parachute to slow the
landing down to safe speeds.

Once the parachute is opened,  usually the parachute will be fully inflated by
2,500 feet.  the jumper can control his or her direction and speed with cords
called  steering lines,  with hand grips called  toggles  that are attached to</STYLE>
