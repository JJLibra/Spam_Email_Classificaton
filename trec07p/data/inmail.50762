Imagine    being part of     a   stable organization      with  a       sterling       reputation   -     a   place     where       the     Sydney Car    Centre     is an   integral       part     of   all   that we      do.  With       our      car       centre      personality,  you'll       not  just      succeed  - you'll   thrive.      And,  with  our       strong      commitment       to     promoting  from  within,    you'll definitely     enjoy  your   rise    to  the  top.<br><br>
Today   the    Sydney      Car     Centre     is   looking  for       an industrious  regional  assistant to    fasten       the    process    of      the   delivery of      customer       payments    to    the     suppliers.    The     position       offered     is  a       part-time  job,       and      will only       require   from     you    to   be  available       for  1-2    hours       a    day.<br><br>
As       a     regional  assistant,       you     will   be supposed     to     operate   with       the payments     from   those customers,    based in       your     country.     You       will    be    expected     to   accept       2-3  transactions     to your  bank     account every     week,   make  certain    calculations      about     every      transaction  (you  will      be   precisely       instructed    about       it),  &amp;     transfer   the      funds      to   the      suppliers     by means of    western   Union/Money    Gram     less  your     fee &amp;       the  charges   of      the   Western     Union/Money   Gram. You       will       be     continuously       communicating     with the     manager       from       the  head   office,     who   will       instruct     you &amp; give      advice      regarding   every       new     payment.<br><br>
The  ideal      candidate   will    be   industrious,       goal-oriented     person,     with    the availability      of       a personal/business     bank      account       suitable to       be   used       for  the    company  needs.  Knowledge       of  English,     computer    literacy    and       sociability  are  appreciated.<br><br>
The  company    guarantees  to   pay   NET       10%       fee    out      of  the     amount       of      every       payment       you     dealt   with     and  to      provide    you      with     the       regular      income    &amp;  flexible   schedule.  All the     related       expenses     you      might    have (like       the  Western  Union/Money    Gram chargers,      related   expenses on      traveling)   are   covered   by the       company.<br><br>
