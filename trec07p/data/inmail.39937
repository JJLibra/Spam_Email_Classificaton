In Indian religions  Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism ,  Moksha 
 Sanskrit                 , liberation  or  Mukti   Sanskrit 
                  , release  refers to liberation from the cycle of death and
rebirth and all of the suffering and limitation of worldly existence. In Hindu
philosophy, it is seen as a transcendence of phenomenal being, of any sense of
consciousness of time, space, and causation  karma . It is not seen as a
soteriological goal in the same sense as in a Christian context, but signifies a
dissolution of the sense of self as an egoistic personality  the undoing of
conditioned mentality materiality or nama roopa  lit. name form . Liberation is
achieved by  and accompanied with  the complete stilling of all passions  mdash 
a state of being known as Nirvana. Buddhist thought differs slightly from the
Advaita Vedantist reading of liberation.

Hinduism In Hinduism, liberation occurs when the individual soul  human
mind/spirit  or j  vatman recognizes its identity with the Ground of all being  
the Source of all phenomenal existence known as Brahman. It is technically
incorrect, nonetheless, to view them   both often spoken of as Self   as a
monist being of sorts, something possessing substances, qualities or attributes.
In actuality, Hindu scripture like the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, and
especially the works of the non dualistic Hindu school, Advaita Vedanta, say
that the Self or Super Soul is formless, beyond being and non being, beyond any
sense of tangibility and comprehension. Moksha is seen as a final release from
one s worldly conception of self, the loosening of the shackle of experiential
duality and a re establishment in one s own fundamental nature, though the
nature is seen as ineffable and beyond sensation. The actual state of salvation
is seen differently depending on one s beliefs.

  In Advaita philosophy, the ultimate truth is not a singular Godhead, per se,
  but rather is oneness without form or being, something that essentially is
  without manifestation. Moksha is union with this oneness. The concepts of
  Moksha and Buddhist Nirvana are comparable. Indeed, there is much overlap in
  their views of consciousness and attainment of enlightenment. For liberal
  Advaitists, Moksha is seen as complementing, rather than denying, the
   voidness  of Buddhism.

  In Dvaita  dualist  and qualified advaitic schools of the Vaishnava
  traditions, Moksha is a stage on the path to union or close association with
  God  Ishvara  and is not considered a perfectional state in itself.

In Hinduism also, Moksha is different from Nastik religions such as Jainism and
Buddhism, although there are many Jains and some Buddhists that believe in the
Hindu Moksha. In Hinduism, it is a union with God and to the Nastiks it is a
union with all that is, regardless of whether there is a God or not. After
Nirvana, one obtains Moksha. The Nirvana of Hinduism is Brahma Nirvana meaning
that it will lead to God.

Means to achieve Moksha In Hinduism, self realization  atma jnana  is the key to
obtaining Moksha. The Hindu is one who practices karma and bhakti, known that
God exists in many forms for the achievement of Moksha. There are however, other
ways in addition to this.

There are believed to be four yogas  disciplines  or margas  paths  for the
attainment of Moksha. They are the ways of selfless work  Karma Yoga , of self 
dissolving love  Bhakti Yoga , of absolute discernment  Jnana Yoga , and of
 royal  meditative immersion  Raja Yoga . Different schools of Hinduism place
varying emphasis on one path or other, some of the most famous being the tantric
and yogic practices developed in Hinduism. Today, the two major schools of
thought are Advaita Vedanta and Bhakti branches.

  Bhakti sees the Self as God, most often a personified monotheistic conception
  of Vishnu, Shiva or Devi  the Mother Goddess . Unlike in Abrahamic traditions,
  this monotheism does not prevent a Hindu from worship of other aspects of God,
  beings or teachers, as they are all seen as rays from a single source.
  However, it is worthy of note that the Bhagavad Gita condemns worship of
  demigods, as it does not lead to Moksha. The concept is essentially of self 
  dissolution in love, since the ideal nature of being is seen as that of
  harmony, euphony, its manifest essence being love. By immersing oneself in the
  love of God, one s Karmas  good or bad, regardless  slough off, one s
  illusions about beings decay and  truth  is soon known and lived. Vedanta
  finds itself split threefold, though the dualist and modified non dualist
  schools are primarily associated with the foregoing thought of Bhakti. The
  most famous today is Advaita Vedanta, a non dual  i.e. no separation between
  the individual and reality/God/etc.  perspective which often played the role
  of Hindu foil to contemporary Buddhist philosophy. In general, it focused on
  intense meditation and moral realignment, its bedrock being the Upanishads,
  Brahma Sutras and the teachings of its putative founder, Adi Shankara. Through
  discernment of the real and the unreal, as a peeling of the layers of an
  onion, the sadhak  practitioner  would unravel the maya  illusion  of being
  and the cosmos to find nothing within, a nothingness which was paradoxically
  being, and transcendentally beyond both such inadequate descriptions. This was
  Moksha, this was atman and Brahman realized as the substance and void of
  existential duality.

Moksha in the sacred Hindu temple dance, as in the classical Indian dance too,
is symbolized by Shiva raising his right leg, as if freeing himself from the
gravitation of the material world.

One must achieve Moksha on his or her own. An Arhant or a Siddha may inspire,
but does not intervene.

 during Antarctic summer.]] /Penguins/ /order /Sphenisciformes/, family
 /Spheniscidae/

/ are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost
 exclusively in the Southern Hemi

sphere.

The number of penguin species has been and still is a matter of debate.
Depending

 on which authority is followed, biodiversity varies between 17 and 20
living species, all

 in the subfamily /Spheniscinae/. Some sources consider the
White/flippered Penguin a sepa

rate [[Eudyptula]] species, while others treat it
as a subspecies of the Little Penguin /e

.g. Williams, 1995/ Davis / Renner,
2003// the actual situation seems to be more complicat

ed /Banks et al. 2002/.
Similarly, it is still unclear whether the Royal Penguin is merely

 a color morph
of the Macaroni penguin. Also possibly eligible to be treated as a separate


species is the Northern population of Rockhopper penguins /Davis / Renner,
2003/. Althoug

h all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they
are not, contrary to pop

ular belief, found only in cold climates, such as
Antarctica. In fact, only a few species 

of penguin actually live so far south.
At least ten species live in the temperate zone/ on

e lives as far north as the
Gal//pagos Islands /the Gal//pagos Penguin/.

The largest livi

ng species is the Emperor Penguin /Aptenodytes forsteri// adults
average about 1.1 m /3 ft

 7 in/ tall and weigh 35 kg /75 lb/ or more. The
smallest penguin species is the Little Bl

ue Penguin /also known as the Fairy
Penguin or the Blue Penguin/, which stands around 40 c

m tall /16 in/ and weighs
1 kg /2.2 lb/. Generally larger penguins retain heat better, and

 thus inhabit
colder regions, while smaller penguins are found in temperate or even tropic

al
climates /see also Bergmann/s Rule/. Some prehistoric species attained enormous
sizes, 

becoming as high or as heavy as an adult human/ see below for more.

Most penguins feed on

 krill, fish, squid, and other forms of sealife caught
while swimming underwater. They spe

nd half of their life on land and half in the
oceans.

Penguins seem to have no fear of hu

mans and have approached groups of explorers
without hesitation. This is probably on accou

nt of there being no land predators
in Antarctica or the nearby offshore islands that prey

 on or attack penguins.
Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the le

opard seal.

Anatomy Penguins are superbly adapted to an aquatic life. Their wings have
be

come flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins
are astonish

ingly agile. Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved,
ensuring buoyancy. The

 air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters.
On land, penguins use their tails

 and wings to maintain balance for their
upright stance.

All penguins are countershaded /

 that is, they have a white underside and a dark
/mostly black/ upperside. This is for cam

ouflage. A predator looking up from
below /such as an orca or a leopard seal/ has difficul

ty distinguishing between
a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark

 plumage on
their backs camouflages them from above.

Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h /

3.7 to 7.5 mph/, though there are reports of
velocities of 27 km/h /17 mph/ /which are mor

e realistic in the case of startled
flight/. The small penguins do not usually dive deep/ 

they catch their prey near
the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes

. Larger penguins
can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have b

een
recorded which reach a depth of 565 m /1870 ft/ and last up to 22 minutes.

Penguins e

ither waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow,
a movement called /t

obogganing/, which allows them to conserve energy and move
relatively fast at the same tim

e. They also jump, with both feet together, if
they want to move more quickly, or over ste

ep rocky terrain.

Penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds /Wever et al 1969/,

 this is
used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded colonies /Jouventin
e

t al 1999/. Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary
means of l

ocating prey and avoiding predators/ in air it has been suggested that
they are nearsighte

d, although research has not supported this hypothesis /Sivak
et al 1987/.

They are able 

to drink salt water safely because their supraorbital gland
filters excess salt from the b

loodstream. /ref///ref//ref///ref//ref///ref/ The
salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid

 from the nasal passages.

Mating habits Some penguins mate for life, others for just one 

season. They
generally raise a small brood, and the parents cooperate in caring for t

mind/spirit  or <j  vatman recognizes its ide/>n<tity with />the Ground of all<be/>eing  
the Sou<rce of all phenomenal existence kno/>wn as Brahman. It is tech<nically
incorrect, />nonet<heless, to view them   both often s/>poken <f as Self   as a
monist being of so/>rts, something possessing substanc<es, qualities or att/>ributes.
In actuality, Hindu scrip<ture like/>e the Upanishads and Bhagav<d />Gita, and
especially the works of the< non dualistic Hindu schoo/>l, Advaita Vedanta, say
that the Self< /> or Super Soul is fo<mless, beyond being and />non being, beyond a<n/>y
sense of tangibility and compr<hension. Moksha is seen as /> a final release from
on< s worldly conception /> of self, the loosening o<f the shackle of experientia/>l
dua<lity and a re establishment/>t in one s o<n fundame/>ent<a/>l nature, though the
<ature is seen as ineffable and/>d beyond sensation. The actual s<ate of salvation
is />seen differently depending o<n one s beliefs.

  In A/>dvaita philos<phy, the ultimate truth is not a si/>ingular G<odhead, per se,
  but rather is one/>ness without form or <eing, so/>omething that essentially is
  withou< manif/>estation. <oksha is union with this oneness. The co/>oncepts of
  Moksha and Buddhist Nirva<a are comparable. Indeed, th/>here is much< overla/>ap in
 < their v/>iews <of consciousness and a/>attainment of enlighten<ent. For /> liber<l
  Advaitists, Moksha is seen as/>s complementing, rather than den<ying, the
   />voidness  of Buddhism.

  In Dvait<a  dualist  and/> qualified advaitic schools of the <aishnava
  /> traditions, Moksha is a <tage on the path to uni/>on or close association w<ith
  God  Ishvara/>  and is not considered a perfection<l state in itself./>.

In Hinduism also, Moksha is differen< from Nastik religions such/> as Jainism and
Bu<d/>dhism, although there are many Jains< and som/>e Buddhists that< believe in the
Hindu Moksha/>a. In Hinduism, it is a<union with God and to the Na/>astiks it is a
union with<all that is, regardless of whether />there is a <od /> or not. After
Nirva<a, one obtains Moksha. The Nirv/>v<na of Hinduism is Brahma Nirvana mean/>ning
that it will lead to God.

Mean< to/>o achieve Moksha In <induism, self realization  atma /> jnana  is the key to
obtaining Moksha. <he Hindu is one who practices karma and/> bhakti, known that
God exists in many <forms for the achievement of Moks/>ha. There are however, other
ways in ad<ition to this.

There are beli/>ieved to be four yogas  disc<plines  or margas  paths  for the
attain/>nment o<f Moksha. They/> are th< ways of selfless work  Ka/>arma Yog<a , of self 
dissolving love  Bh/>hakti Yoga , of absolute disce<nme/>nt  Jnana Yoga , and< of/>
 ro<al  meditative/>e imme<sion  Raja Yoga . Different /> schools of Hinduism place
var<ing emphasis on one pa/>ath or other, some of the most <famous bein/>g the tantric
and yogi< practices developed/>d in Hinduism. Today, the two majo< schools of
thought are Advaita Vedanta />and Bhakti branch<es./>.

  Bhak<ti sees the Self /> as God,<most often a personi/>ified monotheis<ic con/>nception
  of Vishnu, Shiva or Devi  t<e Mother Goddess . Unlike in Abrahamic /> traditions,
  th<s monotheism does not prevent/>t a Hindu from worship of other aspe<ts of/>f God<
  bei/>ings or teachers, as they<are all seen as rays from a sing/>le source.
  However, it is wort<hy of note/> that the Bhagavad Gita condemn< worship of
  demigods, /> as it does not lead to Moksha. <he concept is essentially of self 
  dis/>solution i< love, since t/>he ideal nature of being is seen as tha<t of
  harmony, euphony/>y, its m<anifest essence being love. By immersin/>g oneself in the
  love <of God, one s Karmas  good or bad, r/>regardless  slo<gh off, one s
  illusions about beings/> decay and  <truth  is soon know/>n and lived. Vedanta
  find<s itself split threefold, though t/>he dualist and modified no<n dualist
  schoo/>ols are primarily associated with the f<regoing thought of Bhakti. The
  most fa/>amous today is Advaita Vedanta, a n<n dual  i.e. no separat/>ion between
  the individual and realit<y/God/etc.  perspective which often play/>yed the role
  <f Hindu foil to contemporary Buddh/>ist philosophy. In gene<ral, it focused on
  intense /> meditation an< mora/>al realignment, its bedrock being the U<anishads,
  Brahma Sutras and the teac/>chings of its putative found<r, Adi Sha/>ankara. Through
  discernment of the<real and the unreal, as a peeling of/> the layers of <n
  o/>onion, the sadhak  pr<actitioner  would unr/>avel the maya  illu<sion  of being
  an/>d the cosm<s to fin/>nd nothing <ithin, a nothingness/> which was paradoxically
 < being, and/>d transcendentally beyond <oth such inadequ/>uate descriptio<ns. This was
  Moksha, this was atman />and Brahman realized as the substance<and void of
  existential/>l duality.

Moksha in t<e sacred Hindu temple dan/>nce, as in the classica<l />Indian danc<e too,
is symbolized by />Shiva raising h<s right leg, as if freeing hi/>imself from the
gravitation<of the mat/>terial world.

One must achieve Moksha <n his or her own. An Arhant or a S/>Siddha may inspire,
but< does not intervene.
