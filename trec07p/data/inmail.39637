After our time on Salina, however, a lot else is not so familiar. My
cousin is taking an extended trip to Bhutan next year. But then as
Eduardo, the son of the owner explains, hospitality runs in the family.
With the sound of a massive roman candle a sheet of bright red flame
shoots up from one of four smouldering holes in the crater.
He has apparently forgotten the first rule of politics: you are what you
are. Not a single person asked for a pen, or money, or photographs.
I get up early, I go to sleep late, and I always work very hard. Like
the farmhouse, the truest experiences in Bhutan are unplanned. Oh, and
one last thing. "A lot of the old hippy rhetoric could well be co-opted
now by the pseudo-libertarian right, which has in fact happened.
After our time on Salina, however, a lot else is not so familiar. What I
do care about is the substance, the facts, the details.
In comparison with Salina, Panarea and Stromboli, it s main town feels
something of a metropolis with its bustling port and winding
Vespa-clogged, washing-line-flagged alleyways.
These are difficult times, and they require seriousness and stability.
Captain told us that a journey is the Buddhist metaphor for life , and
to show compassion to a traveller is to add to your own karmic merit. It
is a country of such profound, deep-rooted faith, that it is impossible
to journey through it without being affected.
The first flare of molten rock takes us all by surprise. Zombie Brown
talked encouragingly this week about openness and parliamentary
accountability.
The island and surrounding islets are undeniably pretty, while its tight
strip of houses and hotels backed by hectares of bare rock lend it an
intimate "discovered" feel. These are all, however, just curtain raisers
for the real performance of the volcano itself. Our welcome at Hotel La
Piazza is the warmest we receive anywhere in the islands. He has
apparently forgotten the first rule of politics: you are what you are. I
consider the consequences, not just the spin.
Should you manage to overcome these obstacles and board a Druk Air
flight, it will probably be the most surreal aviation adventure of your
life. Outside, we were met by our guide Yeeshay, a young smiling man
whose job it was to shadow us till our departure a week later, and to
ensure that we were, at all times, having the time of our life.
Our welcome at Hotel La Piazza is the warmest we receive anywhere in the
islands. In search of rustic authenticityPhuntshocholing  farm house
wasn't what I was expecting, not least because I'd booked an upmarket,
modern guesthouse .
It is in this hostile environment that Brown will be asking Britain to
deliver Labour one more chance to do the job. I'd be more than happy to
return to any of the Aeolians, but should the same fate befall us on our
departure as did Odysseus, then I'd hope it was Salina's port we were
blown back to.
The smell of a private gentlemen's club, all beeswax and dusty velvet,
hung over the debate, the outcome of which was about as far as it is
possible to get from openness and accountability.
If it does become law, some of the benefits of the Freedom of
Information Act will continue.
Panarea, while only a boat trip away, is very different from Salina.
Salina is the most unpretentious of islands.
Mark Williams, international economist at Capital Economics, said that
despite a "triple whammy" of measures, little had changed. Should you
manage to overcome these obstacles and board a Druk Air flight, it will
probably be the most surreal aviation adventure of your life.

Sometimes we'd see farmers on their way to Paro with green wheat on
their backs, happy to rest in the sun for a while and smoke an illicit
Silk Cut.
But in this era of personality politics, a more personal presentation
will help explain personal policies.
But change is coming.
Now Eduardo's mother owns La Piazza while her two sisters each own
hotels nearby. William Sutcliffe becomes one of the few travellers lucky
enough to find the real Shangri-La. Do Bhutanese children cry?
