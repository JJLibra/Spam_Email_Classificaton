ERMX Continues To Expand As Stock Climbs Up 16.6%!

EntreMetrix Inc. (ERMX)
$0.21 UP 16.6%

ERMX announced further expansion with K-9 Genetics. Healthy and Premium
dog foods grossed $3.6 Billion in 2006, up from $1.9 billion in previous
years. Read up on ERMX over the holiday, we think you will see even more
fireworks on Thursday morning!

I sent a text msg to Tom last night when RAW began and I saw the
graphic.

If I ever get picked to go on a TLC show where they try and change my
wardrobe, I'll probably tackle one of the hosts.

What a resume booster!
You can get a liquour license easier; you don't have to pay sales tax on
some purchases; you get to have a board of directors! My phone needs
charging.
