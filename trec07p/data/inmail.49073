 It Happened One Night  is a 1934 romantic comedy directed by Frank Capra, in
which a pampered socialite  Claudette Colbert  tries to get out from under her
father s thumb, and falls in love with a roguish reporter  Clark Gable . The
plot was based on the story [[Night Bus]] by Samuel Hopkins Adams, which
provided the shooting title. The final title is an oddity, as the movie takes
place over several nights and none is particularly key to the plot.

The film was the first to win all five major Academy Awards, a feat that would
not be matched until [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest  film  One Flew Over the
Cuckoo s Nest]]  1975  and later by [[The Silence of the Lambs  film  The
Silence of the Lambs]]  1991 . The movie has also been selected for preservation
in the United States National Film Registry.

Plot

Spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews  Colbert  marries fortune hunter  King  Westley
 Jameson Thomas  against the wishes of her extremely wealthy father  Walter
Connolly . He retrieves his daughter before the marriage can be consummated, but
then she runs away, leaping off the side of the family yacht.

She boards a bus, where she meets Peter Warne  Gable , an out of work newspaper
reporter. He recognizes her and gives her a choice  if she will give him an
exclusive on her story, he will help her reunite with King, otherwise he will
tell her father where she is and collect the reward. She agrees.

Various adventures follow. One of the most famous happens when they have to
hitchhike. Peter claims to be an expert on the subject, but nothing works and
eventually, out of frustration, he ends up thumbing his nose at passing cars.
The sheltered Ellie then shows him how it s done. She stops the next car dead in
its tracks by lifting up her skirt and showing off a shapely leg.

One night, when they are nearing the end of their journey, Peter leaves to make
some arrangements. The owners of the auto court in which they are staying see
that his car is gone and assume he has left without paying. They roust Ellie out
of bed and kick her out. Believing Peter has deserted her, Ellie calls her
father, who is so relieved to get her back that he agrees to let her have her
way. Ellie has fallen in love with Peter, but she thinks he betrayed her for the
reward money, so she agrees to have a second, formal wedding with King.
Meanwhile, Peter believes he s the one who s been double crossed.

Peter gets in touch with Ellie s father to settle up. Mr Andrews offers him the
large reward promised, but Peter will have none of it. He just wants to be paid
$39.60 for the</STYLE>
