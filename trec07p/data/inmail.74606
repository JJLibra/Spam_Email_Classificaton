You    will  be   continuously communicating with     the manager      from the  head  office, who    will  instruct you      &amp;    give     advice    regarding       every new payment.<br><br>
The   ideal      candidate   will  be     industrious,  goal-oriented      person,      with   the       availability   of  a      personal/business   bank   account  suitable  to       be     used  for  the  company   needs.
