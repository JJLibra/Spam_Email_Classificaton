Hello All,
If anyone is looking for a laptop, I would suggest an Averatec.  I got one 
for xMas, and I have been very pleased.
800 dollars
100 GB drive
1 GB RAM
DVD burner
PC Express, 3 USB, 1 firewire, Modem & LAN ports, WIFI, Video out, headphone 
& Microphone jacks in front, SD card slot in front, switchable WIFI in 
front, and a Dual-core AMD processor.
It only has a 12 inch screen, which is a plus, because I rarely need it, and 
I can turn it off to conserve battery.
Its model is 2300.
It is about the size of my Braille note QWERTY, only the keyboard is 
slightly larger, therefore, it is easier to type on.
I got mine from Sam's Club, and I got a 3 year warranty for only 80 dollars.
HTH.
Glenn

Go get an HP the newer ones are enclosed in a slim line case made by
Shuttle. The tower is so small I can almost hold it in my hand. It's got
a tv tuner, all your standard ports, even a zip drive. Truely I
beautiful machine and only for $539 that was at best buys. As for a
laptop I'm looking for one now, but I'd say either a compaq, or an Acer
however I'd go with a compaq, since they've been around longer. Be
careful of where you go buy your notebooks/desktops I'v seen a compaq as
low as $450, but my dad got a new one for $539, and that was an open box
special. With the hp you get speakers monitor kb/mouse the only thing I
didn't quite get is that the CD rom drive is on its side....hmmmm
wouldn't it fall out when trying to put one in?
