As far as I know there isn't anybody actively working on anything at the
moment.

Rather than installing all we thing could be public, I think it makes
sense to start by installing just the things that are being used by
plugins /and/ we think should be public. We can always expand later, if
necessary. So I think the first step towards getting this resolved would
be to investigate what functions plugins such as samba-vscan and
samba-pdbsql need exported.

Cheers,
