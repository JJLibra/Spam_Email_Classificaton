There's Nothing On!

The SAT Measures What?

A Company With Predictive Decisioning Software

-----

My wife recently attended a conference in upstate New York and one night
found herself back in her hotel room, turning to the television for
entertainment.

Now, in our family, real-time network television is a rare event.   
Thanks to Replay TV, a one-time competitor of TiVo in the DVR (digital
video recorder) business, our favorite shows get recorded on a big hard
disk and we watch them when we want, skipping the commercials as we go. 
In fact, the only time we watch commercials is during the Super Bowl.

More often, we read.

In any event, there was my wife, in a New York state hotel room, "forced"
to choose from a dreadful selection of real-time network TV offerings.

Of course she could have turned it off, but in that dull hotel room in
that strange town, she was just searching for a little life, a little
humor, a little intelligence.  What she got was bad TV, along with an
onslaught of repetitive, often-insulting commercials.

So she called me, and somewhere along the way she asked, "Why do people
watch this garbage?  And why do the networks play the same commercials,
sometimes several times during the same show?"

I couldn't give her an easy answer, but I did sympathize, and that's
really what she wanted.

Soon after, I googled "top ten TV shows," and here's what I found.

America's Got Talent
Dateline NBC
Deal or No Deal
Law and Order
N-C-I-S
C-S-I
Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?
Two and A Half Men
So You Think You Can Dance?
C-S-I Miami

I've never seen any of these, which goes to show you how out of touch I
am.

But I do know (from reading) that four of them are crime dramas, two are
talent searches, two are game shows, one is a sitcom and one is a news
magazine that typically focuses on human-interest stories.

Reviewing this list, I'm reminded of the words of HL Mencken, who wrote,
"No one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by
underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain
people."

Then, a few days ago one of my editors commented to me, no doubt after
viewing one of the those headlines like "Man Shoots Self in Groin While
Attempting To Make Ham Sandwich," "You know, half of Americans are of
below average intelligence."

Upon reflection, it's obvious.  And it's statistically inevitable.   
The average is near the middle, so half will always be below the average
(technically, below the median, but given the very large numbers we're
dealing with, there's little difference.)

And if you don't know the difference between mean and median, you probably
haven't crammed for an SAT test lately.

The converse, however, does not mean that if you do know the difference
you have crammed for the test recently.  That's logic at work.

And the SAT, now that I've brought it up, is not what it used to be.

In 1901 it debuted as the Scholastic Achievement Test, supposedly
measuring what students had learned.

In 1941, the name was changed to Scholastic Aptitude Test, supposedly
measuring what students were capable of learning, if they had the proper
socio-economic advantages.

In 1990, that was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test, supposedly
measuring . . . something scholastic?

And in 1994 the name was changed to SAT (the letters officially standing
for nothing at all!)

Finally (or, should I say, most recently, because I suspect there are more
changes around the corner), in 2005 the name was changed to SAT Reasoning
Test, creating a potential redundancy of the word "Test" but only if the
first T still stood for Test, which it doesn't.

Reasoning, of course, includes logic, and I like that a lot. I hope they
keep that name for a while.

Now, I took the SAT a few decades back.  Two of my kids have taken it and
the third is likely to in a couple years.  But something else has changed
over the decades besides the name.  In 1995 the yardstick for scoring was
adjusted to account for the growing number of kids from less rigorous
schools taking the test.

The reason?  The big bulge in the middle of the distribution curve, which
had previously been centered at 400, had slipped down into the mid-300s. 
To get the mid-point back up, the average verbal score was artificially
increased by some 70 points while the average math score had 20-30 points
added.

The kids at the top and bottom were barely affected, but the masses of
average kids near the middle saw their scores bumped up dramatically.

What does it matter?  Well, a good score helps you get into college.   
But is there a correlation between success on the SAT and success in
college?  Looking further out, is there correlation between success on the
SAT and success in life?

The simple answer is, some, but not a lot.  And more and more colleges are
recognizing that; the number of colleges that admit students without
regard to test scores now exceeds 400.

But the SAT lives on, and will continue to be here for years to come. 
Why?  In part because it's the product of The College Board.   
The College Board is a non-profit organization, and while there's no doubt
that it works hard to serve the high schools and colleges and families
that use it, there's even less doubt - in my mind - that the organization
works even harder to ensure its own survival.

Speaking of intelligence, here's a news item I noticed recently.

"A financial services firm in Japan has begun offering lower mortgage
interest rates to "intelligent" customers.  GE Consumer Finance Company is
giving discounts to people who have good English or computer skills, and
work in "high-value" areas such as the law.  The company says more highly
skilled workers usually find it easier than others to get jobs and to keep
them. They are therefore less likely to become insolvent and default on
their home loan.  GE Consumer Finance Company claims this is the first
time that mortgage rates have been calculated like this in Japan.  People
who have high scores on a test of English proficiency and officially
certified IT skills can apply for a small discount.  Those of them who
also have certain jobs - such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and
financial experts - can obtain further discounts.  If a couple are both
employed in the 20 "high-value" professions listed by the company, they
will be entitled to a major rate reduction."

It makes sense, and I'm guessing it's illegal to discriminate that way in
the U.S.

Getting back to TV, the problem is not just the quality of programming but
the quantity of time people spend viewing.

The TV is on for over 7 hours in the average American home, and the
average American watches over 4 hours of TV per day.

Worse still, the average American child watches 1,023 hours of TV a year
and spends 900 hours in school.

And one thing they're seeing in those hours is commercials.  For broadcast
TV, commercials pay the bills, and the advertisers are doing all they can
to ensure that the message from those commercials reaches your brain.

But more and more these days, people are working to avoid those
commercials by fast-forwarding through them using DVRs.

So NBC recently tested people to see if those commercials had any impact
at high-speed.  NBC, you know, wants its advertisers' money even if
viewers are watching at fast speeds.

The result, according to a story three days ago in The New York Times,
"judging from the biological reactions, the test subjects were just as
engaged while watching fast-forwarded advertisements as they were while
viewing opening scenes from the NBC show "Heroes" at regular speed."

When it comes to fast-forward advertisements, "the assumption has always
been that they have no economic value, that they have no communication
value," said Alan Wurtzel, president for research at NBC Universal. "But
the fact of the matter is we're learning that they are valuable."

And they're so "valuable" to the financial health of the TV industry that
the commercial-skipping DVR that I bought years ago can no longer be
bought!

But the problem is not just the commercials.  The problem is that every
minute spent watching TV is a minute not being used to reflect, to do
something productive, or to interact with other family members.

And the result of all this TV viewing, according to a recent study by the
Culture and Media Institute, is that "increased exposure to television
correlates with a decline in acceptance of personal responsibility."

Now, it's important to note that the word correlate was used there.   
Officially, there's no established causality.  But my sense is that our
country has seen a marked decrease in a sense of personal responsibility;
that too many people all too easily blame others for their troubles.

And when personal responsibility shrinks, we get a culture that thinks
it's okay to act stupid because somebody else will pick up the tab.

And now, finally, here we are at today's stock.

It's about intelligence and it's about marketing, and if you understand
how important marketing is to the world, you may like this one enough to
invest in it.

You know and I know that at every turn, companies are doing their darndest
to sell us things.  At Amazon they know what I've bought before and thus
know what to sell me next.  And at Netflix they know what movies I've
rated highly so they can suggest other movies they think I'd enjoy.

Those two firms have developed specialized software that serves their
individual needs, but for most companies, there's off-the-shelf software
that works very well, and a lot of it is coming from a company named
Chordiant.

Here's what we wrote in a recent issue of Cabot Top Ten Report.

"Chordiant (CHRD) makes customer service and marketing software that helps
big companies deal with their customers, so that the goals of both the
merchant and the customer are met. Customers include 21st Century
Insurance, Bank of Ireland, Banque Populaire, Barclays, Capital One, Covad
Communications, Cox Communications, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Lloyds, MetLife,
Nokia, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Dutch Shell, Time Warner
Cable, T-Mobile, UPS and Wachovia. These are huge blue-chip companies, yet
Chordiant is still a small company, and growing fast. Historically, the
company has had trouble making a profit (its last profitable year was
2004), but after the first quarter's terrific results, CEO Steven R.
Springsteel commented that solid profitability was "due to the strong
performance in our international business, the acceleration of percentage
of completion project implementations in Europe, and greater enablement of
our partners resulting in fewer Chordiant resources being required on some
project implementations." It sounds good to us. Since then the company has
been awarded a patent for "advanced predictive decisioning technology." In
other words, the companies using this software sometimes know what you're
going to buy before you do! As companies come to depend on this software,
Chordiant's future is likely to be consistently profitable, and the
realization of that is why the stock is strong today."

Digging deeper, I see that Chordiant has been growing revenues since 2003,
and in the latest quarter saw revenues grow 25% from the year before to
$32.8 million, while earnings jumped from a penny per share to $0.18 per
share.  Analysts are projecting a profit of $0.48 per share this year and
$0.72 per share next year.  And the after-tax profit margin was a fat
19.6%.

Trading at 16, it's rather low-priced and thus carries the extra risk of
volatility that comes from stocks at this level.   But average trading
volume is nearly 500,000 shares per day, and institutional interest is
growing.  I'd like it better on a dip to 15, but if it doesn't dip there
in the week ahead, 16 may be the best price you'll get.
