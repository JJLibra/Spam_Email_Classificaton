>>The Situation
>>
>>
>>
>>On Tuesday, July 03, 2007, two Co-Chairs of the
>>Korean Alliance against the Korea-U.S. FTA, Oh
>>Jong-ryul and Jung Gwang-hoon, were arrested on
>>charges of carrying out ‘illegal’ and
>>‘non-permitted’ protests against the free
>>trade agreement between U.S. and Korea. Mr. Oh
>>and Mr. Jung are currently detained at a police
>>station in Seoul; in a few days, they will be
>>relocated to another jail where they will await
>>sentencing. Korea’s consitution does not
>>recognize a permit system for rallies; only a
>>notice needs to be given, which we have done so
>>without fail. We, the Korean Alliance, thus
>>feel that their arrests are a direct violation
>>of democratic and constitutional right to
>>assemble and express our opinion. Since its
>>formation in March 2006, the Korean Alliance
>>has organized peaceful and legal demonstrations
>>against what we think is a seriously unjust
>>agreement for the people of Korea, the U.S.,
>>and the world. However, since November 2006,
>>the Roh Moo-hyun Administration has declared
>>all Korean Alliance’s public rallies illegal.
>>Police suppression has been severe on all
>>activities of the Korean Alliance. We believe
>>that the Roh Moo-hyun Administration has
>>gravely violated fundamental rights of the
>>people to assemble and oppose any unjust government practices.
>>
>>
>>
>>Mr. Oh was born in 1938 in the city of Kwangju.
>>He helped establish the Korean Teachers and
>>Education Workers’ Union, for which he was
>>imprisoned. He has worked tirelessly for
>>democracy, unification, and the abolition of
>>Korea’s National Security Law, the latter for
>>which he was again imprisoned. Mr. Jung was
>>born in 1939 in the city of Haenam. He has been
>>active in the democratic movement to demand
>>government responsibility, for which he was
>>imprisoned for 4 years. He has served as
>>President of the Korean Peasants’ League, the
>>national federation of small farmers’
>>organizations. He has for years led the
>>farmers’ movement against the WTO and free trade.

>>Call for International Protest Letter

>>International Protest Letter
>>
>>In Protest against the Arrests of Oh Jong-ryul and Jung Gwang-hoon
>>
>>
>>
>>We Demand their Immediate Release!
>>
>>We Demand an Immediate End to Police Suppression of the Korean Alliance!
>>
>>
>>
>>July 3, 2007
>>
>>
>>
>>From: International Community Concerned about
>>Democratic Principles and Economic and Social Justice
>>
>>
>>
>>To: South Korea’s President Roh Moo-hyun
>>
>>
>>
>>We are serisouly disappointed and troubled by
>>the police suppression of the Korean Alliance
>>against the Korea-U.S. FTA and the arrests of
>>its two officers. We write this urgent letter
>>to demand 1) the immediate release of Mr. Oh
>>Jong-ryul and Mr. Jung Gwang-hoon, two
>>Co-Chairs of the Korean Alliance and 2) an
>>immediate end to police suppression of the Korean Alliance.
>>
>>
>>
>>First, the arrests of Mr. Oh and Mr. Jung are a
>>direct violation of basic democratic principles
>>and constitutional rights. We believe that
>>South Korea is a democratic nation that
>>guarantees, under the constitution, the right
>>to associate and oppose unjust practices of
>>ruling authority. These rights are fundamental
>>to any democratic nation, and we strongly feel
>>that today's arrests may represent a
>>retrogression of Korea's status as a democratic
>>nation. In addition, the police’s disregard
>>for their old age and health conditions shows a sign of inhumane treatment.
>>
>>
>>
>>Second, their arrests are an infringement of
>>international principles of political and civil
>>rights. As a member of the United Nations,
>>South Korea has signed on to connventions that
>>protect and promote the advancement of social
>>freedom and human rights. South Korea has made
>>important democratic strides since the 1970s.
>>We have witnessed this transformation. We urge
>>the Roh Moo-hyun Administration, elected by
>>democratic means, to not forget Korea’s
>>history and to foster international and
>>democratic principles. The rights of the people
>>to assemble and express their voices must be protected.
>>
>>
>>
>>And third, we demand an immediate end of police
>>suppression against the Korean Alliance. We are
>>aware that South Korea’s constitution
>>(Article 21) does not recognize a permit system
>>for rallies; only notices need to be given,
>>which the Korean Alliance has done without
>>fail. Therefore, we believe that the activities
>>of the Korean Alliance is by no means illegal.
>>The police suppression of FTA protests, which
>>we have seen in the media, is shocking. The
>>fact that the Korean Alliance’s activities
>>are singled out and determined as illegal
>>indicates a direct attack against a people’s
>>organization and an obvious violation of Korea’s constitution.
>>
>>
>>
>>We disapprove the decisions made by the Roh
>>Moo-hyun Administration on the officers and
>>activities of the Korean Alliance. Along with
>>the recent suppression of Korean auto workers,
>>we fear that the suppression of the Korean
>>Alliance signals a dangerous digressive trend
>>in Korea’s democracy. If this trend
>>continues, we can promise the Administration
>>that the international community will not sit
>>still. We urge the Administration to correct
>>its mistakes and return the rights that are
>>inherent to the people of Korea and the world.
