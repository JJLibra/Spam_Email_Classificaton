Imagine     being   part      of a     stable  organization with a      sterling  reputation     -   a      place   where    the       Sydney    Car    Centre   is   an     integral   part    of  all   that    we  do.

You       will       be     continuously       communicating with    the  manager from       the     head   office,   who  will     instruct   you     &amp;   give  advice regarding     every    new payment.<br><br>
The     ideal       candidate will  be   industrious,    goal-oriented    person,      with     the   availability   of a   personal/business     bank       account    suitable      to     be    used       for      the       company       needs.
