        TXP Corporation ("TXP") ("TXPO") an Original Design
        Manufacturer (ODM), specializes in quick-turn complex
        circuit card assemblies and optoelectronic prototyping,
        new product introduction, and pilot production of
        electronic assemblies for Technology Innovators and
        Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and Contract
        Manufacturers (CM) in the U.S.  The company has
        approximately 80 employees and is located in a 47,271
        square-foot high-tech facility in Richardson, Texas,
        the heart of the “Telecom Corridor” in the Dallas
        Metroplex.


                      You've heard of an OEM.  Now,
                      let me explain what an ODM is

                     An Original Design
                     Manufacturer (ODM) is a
                     company that manufactures a
                     product that ultimately will
                     be branded by another company
                     for sale. Such companies
                     allow the branding firm to
                     produce (either as a
                     supplement or solely) without
                     having to engage in the
                     organization or running of a
                     factory. The ODM business has
                     grown in recent years and
                     many are now sufficient in
                     size to handle production for
                     multiple clients, often
                     providing a large portion of
                     overall production. A primary
                     attribute of this business
                     model is that the ODM owns
                     and/or designs in-house the
                     products that are branded by
                     the buying firm.

         TXP helps the engineering teams of its customers ready
                  new products for volume manufacturing

        TXP technology focuses on complex printed circuit board
        assemblies, photonics, optoelectronics, and advanced
        packaging solutions. TXP has three primary business
        units: TXP-iPhotonics, TXP-Retrofit Solutions, and
        TXP-Texas Prototypes.

        TXP-iPhotonics develops and markets via an (ODM)
        Original Design Manufacturing model a family of ONT
        products to both OEMs and the ILECs to be private label
        branded.  The ONT technology terminates the passive
        optical network at the home or business location, and
        enables integrated voice, video and high-speed Internet
        access.

        TXP-Retrofit Solutions provides custom engineering kits
        to enable ILECs (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers) to
        upgrade their local access service delivery
        infrastructure at minimum cost and time. TXP's retrofit
        kits enable a wide range of next-generation telecom
        platforms to easily fit into the variety of remote
        cabinets that have been broadly deployed by ILECs over
        the last 30 years.

        TXP-Texas Prototypes provides pre-manufacturing
        services for the electronics industry that help
        original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) bring products
        to market both faster and more cost effectively. TXP
        excels in both global design and supply chain solution
        services for new product development, which include:
        prototyping and quick-turn electronic assembly; new
        product introduction; pilot production; material supply
        chain development; as well as the transfer of products
        into production.

                      The Future and TXP iPhotonics

             To better understand the iPhotonics business
             opportunity it is important to understand
             today’s competition between CATV companies
             and ILECs. The coax cable infrastructure of
             CATV’s has always had far greater bandwidth
             carrying capacity than the copper wire
             infrastructure of an ILEC.  But only recently
             have CATVs started taking advantage of their
             bandwidth capabilities to steal residential
             and some business customers from ILECs. The
             only way ILECs can compete with CATVs, and
             maybe surpass them, is to put a fiber-based
             service delivery infrastructure in place,
             even if VDSL-over-copper provides significant
             improvements. Whether it be FTTH (Fiber to
             the Home) or FTTC (Fiber to the Curb), the
             “ultimate” solution means deploying fiber out
             to, or much closer to, customers. Ultimately,
             TXP believes the CATV’s will be forced into
             doing the same thing.

             In several respects, FTTH initiatives are a
             reprise of the ADSL infrastructure upgrades
             which began in the mid-1990’s and have
             succeeded in delivering true “broadband”
             services to nearly 50% of all homes in the
             U.S. and approximately 20% of homes globally.
             ADSL aims to deliver high-speed data services
             and internet access.  FTTH delivers voice,
             data, and video services. ADSL (and the
             successor technology VDSL) is utilized to
             extract much higher bandwidth delivery
             capability from the existing copper-based
             local loop network.  PON (Passive Optical
             Network) is the FTTH technology that ILECs
             have broadly chosen to deliver much higher
             bandwidth.  These bandwidths are larger than
             their archrival competitors, the CATV
             companies.  An ONT is the device which is
             located at the individual customer premise to
             receive PON-delivered services.  Where ADSL
             service rollouts had the benefit of
             already-deployed copper wire loops to all
             customers, PON requires the ILEC to install,
             at considerable cost, fiber cables to each
             customer premise. Think: Movies-on-Demand

         TXP became an ODM when it acquired the optical network
           terminal (ONT) business of Siemens in December 2006

        An ODM works closely with OEM’s to develop generally
        high volume products which are product line adjuncts
        for the ODM.  In this case, ONT’s will be used by
        telephone companies to deliver voice, data, and video
        services (triple play services) to residential and
        business customers.

        TXP’s core technology focus is on complex printed
        circuit board (PCB) assemblies for high speed, digital,
        analog, and RF technologies.  By working closely with
        their customers' engineering groups and being highly
        responsive to their requirements throughout the design
        processes, TXP can be an integral part of customer
        operations, accelerate their time-to-market and
        time-to-volume production as well as reducing their
        overall product costs.

           As part of its Siemens acquisition TXP was granted
            access to 18 patents surrounding Siemens Optical
           Network Terminal (ONT) technology, supporting both
          Broadband Passive Optical Network (BPON) and Gigabit
               Passive Optical Network (GPON) standards.

         Material supply chain management services increased 49%
               from $286,000 in 2005 to $427,000 in 2006
                                    a
              TXP expanded its
              customer base from 67
              in 2005 to 103 in
              2006 and had current
              active customers for
              the quarter of 26 and
              38 for 2005 and 2006,
              respectively.                 [Image]

              TXP's top five
              customers accounted
              for 95% of revenue in
              2005 and 50% of
              revenue in 2006.

        commercialization of the technology. We recently
        announced shipments for our first Broadband Passive
        Optical Network (BPON) ONT units to a major Original
        Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and a Tier I carrier, both
        of which represent major milestones for the company. We
        also entered into a reseller agreement with a major
        communications technology and infrastructure provider
        that has begun distributing TXP's BPON ONT units to its
        customers."

        "As we had anticipated, the major systems vendors and
        carriers are beginning to explore OEM sourcing for more
        cost-effective, time-sensitive ONT solutions that are
        interoperable across a wide range of networks. We have
        now demonstrated interoperability with three leading
        Optical Line Terminal (OLT) OEMs and are moving to
        demonstrate interoperability across all major
        platforms. Moreover, we believe our pre-manufacturing
        services model and quick-turn capabilities enable us to
        bring products to market faster and more cost
        effectively than traditional providers. These combined
        capabilities position TXP to become a leading provider
        of ONTs to support the accelerated roll-out of
        'fiber-to-home' services nationwide."

        Mr. Shores continued, "Our core prototyping and
        retrofit businesses continue to generate very strong
        top-line growth, as evidenced by a 249% increase in
        company-wide revenue over the fourth quarter last year.
        Following the formation of our ONT business, we
        absorbed additional overhead; however, we believe it
        was well worth the investment. Our ONT business
        contains mostly fixed costs with a highly leverageable
        infrastructure and sufficient capacity to support our
        needs for the foreseeable future. As our ONT business
        continues to grow and we begin to cover the additional
        fixed costs, we expect the division will become a major
        contributor to our overall profitability. In addition
        to our ONT business, we expect 2007 will also represent
        our best year ever for both the prototyping and
        retrofit divisions."

          TXP Announces First ONT Shipments to a Major OEM and
                             Tier I Carrier

        RICHARDSON, TX--(MARKET WIRE)--Mar 8, 2007 -- TXP
        Corporation (OTC BB:TXPO.OB - News), an Original Design
        Manufacturer (ODM) for the electronics and
        telecommunications industries, announced today that it
        has shipped its first Broadband Passive Optical Network
        (BPON) Optical Network Terminal (ONT) units to a major
        Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and a Tier I
        Carrier. The shipments included both single family unit
        (SFU) and multiple-dwelling unit (MDU4) models.

        Michael C. Shores, President and CEO, stated, "These
        first shipments are a major milestone for the company,
        as we begin commercialization of the ONT product line
        we recently acquired from Siemens. These orders also
        validate our two-pronged strategy of pursuing both
        carriers and OEMs."

        Mr. Shores continued, "Similar to the model followed in
        the maturing DSL market just a few years ago, the major
        systems vendors and carriers are beginning to explore
        OEM sourcing for more cost-effective, time-sensitive
        ONT solutions that are interoperable across a wide
        range of networks. We believe that our
        pre-manufacturing services model and quick-turn
        capabilities enable us to bring products to market both
        faster and more cost-effectively than traditional
        providers. This allows us to provide customized BPON
        and GPON ONTs to industry partners with a much faster
        turnaround time and at very attractive price points.

        "This new ONT business has the potential to
        dramatically expand our photonics business and we are
        extremely excited about the prospects for this
        business, given the massive expenditures planned by the
        carriers as they role out new 'triple-play' and
        'Fiber-to-the-Home' services nationwide."

        Press Release Source: TXP Corporation
        Thursday March 1, 7:30 am ET

              TXP Announces ONT Supply Agreement With Major
                       Communications Technology
                       and Infrastructure Provider

        RICHARDSON, TX--(MARKET WIRE)--Mar 1, 2007 -- TXP
        Corporation (OTC BB:TXPO.OB - News), an Original Design
        Manufacturer (ODM) for the electronics and
        telecommunications industries, announced today that it
        has entered into an agreement to supply its Optical
        Network Terminal (ONT) equipment to a major provider of
        communications technology and infrastructure equipment.

        ONTs are the customer premise located devices used by a
        carrier to serve residential and business customers
        over a PON-based (Passive Optical Networking) system.
        PON is a maturing point-to-multipoint technology which
        is being adopted by telephone companies globally
        because of its cost effectiveness in extending
        fiber-based service delivery all the way to the
        customer premise (Fiber-to-the-Home [FTTH] or
        Fiber-to-the-Premise [FTTP]). TXP's ONTs sit at each
        customer premise and are connected over fiber to an
        Optical Line Terminal (OLT) generally located in the
        carrier's central office. A single OLT can deliver
        services to hundreds of ONTs.

        Michael C. Shores, President and CEO, stated, "We are
        very excited about this new partnership, which we
        believe marks the first of many ODM (Original Design
        Manufacturer) relationships with PON equipment
        manufacturers who will use our ONTs to provide
        PON-based service delivery solutions to carriers
        worldwide. We think our family of BPON and GPON ONTs
        are perfectly timed with the accelerating roll-out of
        new 'fiber-to-home' infrastructures needed to deliver
        'triple-play' services." This agreement comes just 2
        months after TXP officially acquired the ONT business
        unit of Siemens.

        Tuesday December 5, 7:30 am ET

          TXP's iPhotonics Division Finalizes License Agreement
                             With Siemens
                          for ONT Technologies

        RICHARDSON, TX--(MARKET WIRE)--Dec 5, 2006 -- TXP
        Corporation (OTC BB:TXPO.OB - News), a global provider
        of Pre-Manufacturing Services for the electronics and
        telecommunications industries today announced that it
        has finalized its license agreement with Siemens
        Networks Germany granting access to more than 15
        patents surrounding its Optical Network Terminal (ONT)
        technology, supporting both Broadband Passive Optical
        Network (BPON) and Gigabit Passive Optical Network
        (GPON) standards.

        Michael C. Shores, President and CEO, stated,
        "Finalizing this license and asset transfer agreement
        now allows us to focus on commercialization of the ONT
        technology, which is a critical component of the
        "triple-play" roll-outs which are currently being
        deployed by the carriers nationwide. Under the new
        licensing agreement, we are now responsible for
        overseeing manufacturing and will have rights to market
        and immediately begin selling the ONT technology. In
        addition, Siemens is transferring all of its related
        assets, which will allow us to ramp up quickly, to meet
        the anticipated demand from the carriers."

        PON is a point-to-multipoint, fiber to the premises
        network architecture, in which unpowered or passive
        optical splitters are used to connect a single optical
        fiber to multiple premises. The ONT technology to be
        further developed and marketed by TXP's iPhotonics
        division terminates the PON at the home or business
        location, and enables integrated voice, video and
        high-speed internet access.

Now, let me explain what an <u>ODM</u> is</font></font></i></b></center>

<p><b><font color="#666666">An <u>Original Design Manufacturer</u> (ODM)
is a company that manufactures a product that ultimately will be branded
by another company for sale. Such companies allow the branding firm to
produce (<i>either as a supplement or solely</i>) without having to engage
in the organization or running of a factory. The ODM business has grown
in recent years and many are now sufficient in size to handle production
for multiple clients, often providing a large portion of overall production.
<u>A
primary attribute of this business model is that the ODM owns and/or designs
in-house the products that are branded by the buying firm</u>.</font></b></td>

<blockquote><font color="#000000">To better understand <b>the iPhotonics
business</b> <b>opportunity</b> it is important to understand today’s competition
between CATV companies and ILECs. The coax cable infrastructure of CATV’s
has always had far greater bandwidth carrying capacity than the copper
wire infrastructure of an ILEC.&nbsp; But only recently have CATVs started
taking advantage of their <u>bandwidth capabilities to steal residential
and some business customers from ILECs</u>. The only way ILECs can compete
with CATVs, and maybe surpass them, is to put a fiber-based service delivery
infrastructure in place, even if VDSL-over-copper provides significant
improvements. Whether it be FTTH (Fiber to the Home) or FTTC (Fiber to
the Curb), the “ultimate” solution means deploying fiber out to, or much
closer to, customers. <u>Ultimately, TXP believes the CATV’s will be forced
into doing the same thing</u>.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">In several respects, FTTH initiatives are a reprise
of the ADSL infrastructure upgrades which began in the<b> mid-1990’s</b>
and <u>have succeeded in delivering true “broadband” services to nearly
50% of all homes in the U.S. and approximately 20% of homes globally.</u>
ADSL aims to deliver high-speed data services and internet access.&nbsp;
FTTH delivers voice, data, and video services. ADSL (and the successor
technology VDSL) is utilized to extract much higher bandwidth delivery
capability from the existing copper-based local loop network.&nbsp; PON
(Passive Optical Network) is the FTTH technology that ILECs have broadly
chosen to deliver
</font><font color="#CC6600">much higher bandwidth.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000">
These bandwidths are larger than their archrival competitors, the CATV
companies.&nbsp; An ONT is the device which is located at the individual
customer premise to receive PON-delivered services.&nbsp; Where ADSL service
rollouts had the benefit of already-deployed copper wire loops to all customers,
PON requires the ILEC to install, at considerable cost, fiber cables to
each customer premise. </font><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+1>Think:

WIRE)--Apr 5, 2007 -- TXP Corporation (OTC BB:TXPO.OB - News)</font></font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>,
an Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) for the telecommunications industry,
today announced financial results for the three and twelve months ended
December 31, 2006. The company also announced that it completed a private
placement for gross proceeds of $5.0 million to accelerate its ONT strategy.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Michael C. Shores, President
and Chief Executive Officer of TXP, commented, "We are extremely pleased
with the rapid progress of our new Optical Network Terminal (ONT) business,
which we formed after hiring the former Siemens ONT development team in
late 2006. The integration has gone seamlessly and we have begun commercialization
of the technology. We recently announced shipments for our first Broadband
Passive Optical Network (BPON) ONT units to a major Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM) and a Tier I carrier, both of which represent major
milestones for the company. We also entered into a reseller agreement with
a major communications technology and infrastructure provider that has
begun distributing TXP's BPON ONT units to its customers."</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>"As we had anticipated,
the major systems vendors and carriers are beginning to explore OEM sourcing
for more cost-effective, time-sensitive ONT solutions that are interoperable
across a wide range of networks. We have now demonstrated interoperability
with three leading Optical Line Terminal (OLT) OEMs and are moving to demonstrate
interoperability across all major platforms. Moreover, we believe our pre-manufacturing
services model and quick-turn capabilities enable us to bring products
to market faster and more cost effectively than traditional providers.
These combined capabilities position TXP to become a leading provider of
ONTs to support the accelerated roll-out of 'fiber-to-home' services nationwide."</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Mr. Shores continued,
"Our core prototyping and retrofit businesses continue to generate very
strong top-line growth, as evidenced by a 249% increase in company-wide
revenue over the fourth quarter last year. Following the formation of our
ONT business, we absorbed additional overhead; however, we believe it was
well worth the investment. Our ONT business contains mostly fixed costs
with a highly leverageable infrastructure and sufficient capacity to support
our needs for the foreseeable future. As our ONT business continues to
grow and we begin to cover the additional fixed costs, we expect the division
will become a major contributor to our overall profitability. In addition
to our ONT business, we expect 2007 will also represent our best year ever
for both the prototyping and retrofit divisions."</font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1></font></font>

fiber-based service delivery all the way to the customer premise (Fiber-to-the-Home
[FTTH] or Fiber-to-the-Premise [FTTP]). TXP's ONTs sit at each customer
premise and are connected over fiber to an Optical Line Terminal (OLT)
generally located in the carrier's central office. A single OLT can deliver
services to hundreds of ONTs.</font></font></font>
