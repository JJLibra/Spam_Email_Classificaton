 John Calvin Coolidge Jr.   July 4 1872  ndash  January 5 1933 , known primarily
as  Calvin Coolidge , was the 30th President of the United States  1923   1929 .
A lawyer from Vermont, Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts
state politics, eventually becoming governor of that state. His actions during
the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight. He was
elected as the 29th Vice President in 1920 and succeeded to the Presidency upon
the death of Warren G. Harding. He was elected in his own right in 1924, and
gained a reputation as a small government conservative.

In many ways, Coolidge s style of governance was a throwback to the passive
Presidency of the nineteenth century. ref Sobel, 14 /ref  He restored public
confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor s
administration, and left office with considerable popularity. ref McCoy,
420   421  Greenberg, 49   53 /ref  As his biographer later put it,  he embodied
the spirit and hopes of the middle class, could interpret their longings and
express their opinions. That he did represent the genius of the average is the
most convincing proof of his strength.  ref Fuess, 500 /ref 

Many would later criticize Coolidge as a part of a general criticism of laissez 
faire government, especially in times of economic hardship, such as the Great
Depression. ref McCoy, 418  Greenberg, 146   150  Ferrell, 66   72 /ref  His
reputation underwent a renaissance during the Reagan administration, ref Sobel,
12   13  Greenberg, 2   3 /ref  but the ultimate assessment of his presidency is
still divided between those who approve of his reduction of the size of
government and those who believe the federal government should be more involved
in mitigating some of the adverse effects of capitalism. ref Greenberg,
1   7 /ref 

Family and early life Birth and family history John Calvin Coolidge Jr. was born
in Plymouth, Windsor County, Vermont, on July 4 1872, the only U.S. President to
be born on the 4th of July. He was the elder of two children of John Calvin Sr.
and Victoria Moor Coolidge. His only sister, Abigail Granum, died of
appendicitis. ref Fuess, 36 /ref 

The Coolidge family had deep roots in New England. His earliest American
ancestor, John Coolidge, emigrated from Cambridge, England, around 1630 and
settled in Watertown, Massachusetts. ref name fuess12 Fuess, 12 /ref  Coolidge s
great great grandfather, also named John Coolidge, was an American army officer
in the American Revolution, and was one of the first selectmen of the town of
Plymouth Notch. ref Fuess, 7 /ref  Most of Coolidge s direct ancestors were
farmers. The more well known Coolidges, such as architect Charles Allerton
Coolidge, and diplomat Archibald Cary Coolidge, were descended from other
branches of the family that had stayed in Massachusetts. ref name fuess12/ 

Coolidge s grandfather, Calvin Galusha Coolidge, held some local government
offices in Plymouth and was best remembered as a man with  a fondness for
practical jokes.  ref Fuess, 14 /ref  His grandmother, Sarah Brewer Coolidge,
was also of New England stock. It is through this ancestor that Coolidge claimed
to be descended in part from American Indians. ref name mccoy5 McCoy, 5 /ref 
Coolidge s father was also a farmer, but spent some time as a schoolteacher and
justice of the peace. ref Fuess, 16 /ref  His mother, Victoria Josephine Moor
Coolidge, was the daughter of another Plymouth Notch farmer. ref Fuess, 17 /ref 
Coolidge s mother was chronically ill, possibly suffering from tuberculosis, and
died young in 1884, but Coolidge s father lived to see him become
President. ref McCoy, 5  White, 11 /ref 

Education Coolidge attended St. Johnsbury Academy in Vermont before entering
Amherst College in nearby
Massachusetts. ref [http //www.amherst.edu/about_amh/alums.html Accomplished
alumni.] Amherst College. Retrieved on 2007 05 18  /ref  He dropped John from
his name upon graduating from college. At Amherst, Coolidge became a member of
the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta and joined the College Republicans in
1892. ref White, 35 /ref  While there, Coolidge met Dwight Morrow, who would
become a life long friend. ref Sobel, 36 /ref  Coolidge would later credit
Charles E. Garman, a professor of philosophy and ethics, with having a
significant influence on his education. ref Autobiography, 63   70 /ref  He
graduated [[cum laude]] in 1895. ref name sobel41 Sobel, 41 /ref  At graduation,
Coolidge was selected by his classmates to compose and read the Grove Oration, a
humorous speech traditionally given during the graduation ceremony. ref

History It is said 

that Silverhill derived its name from a man living on the
hill in the vicinity where the v

illage is now located. While the man/s name was
not Silver, it is said that he did not han

dle any other money than silver,
therefore they called him Silver/ hence the village name.

 However that may be,
it is the fact that the name Silverhill appears in the records of th

e express
company as early as 1861, with this notation/ /Express office Mobile/ Post
Offic

e address Daphne./ The writer is informed that Silverhill in those days
extended from Fish

 River to Black Water.

Silverhill, as we know it today, was founded in 1897 by Oscar John

son, C. O.
Carlson and C. A. Valentin, of Chicago, Illinois. It was the intention of the
f

ounders to establish a purely Scandinavian colony in Alabama, and, after
investigating the

 Gulf Coast region thoroughly, these gentlemen decided upon the
present location of Silver

hill, in Baldwin County. Land was acquired by purchase
from a Mr. Harford, the first block

 of land being 1,500 acres, which was added
to from time to time as the colonization work 

progressed.

Scandinavian settlers came to Silverhill from virtually every state in the Un

ion
and began the development of what is now the Silverhill district. They found the
soil 

responsive and climate ideal, and it soon became known among the
Scandinavians throughout 

the country that Baldwin County in Alabama was, without
a doubt, one of the most beautiful

 spots in the country. As a consequence,
people readily responded to advertising, and almo

st every month, from October to
May, large parties of home/seekers came to the newly found

ed colony. It was
pioneering, however, in the fullest sense of the word. There was no rail

road
from Bay Minette to Foley in those days. Whatever was produced had to be hauled
to Ma

rlow and then transported by boat to Mobile, or else hauled to Daphne and
from there to Mo

bile by boat. It was, of course, impracticable to load in
carlots and ship to northern mar

kets as is now done/ consequently, the farmers
were depended upon the Mobile market, which

 at that time was not sufficient to
take care of the production. The result was that while

 the new settlers were
delighted with the climate, the productiveness of the soil, the pur

e water,
etc., what they produced brought them no revenue/ and most of the settlers,
havin

g no capital to rely upon, had to seek work outside of their farms and many
were compelled

 to return to the North to earn a living. Notwithstanding the
hardships incidental to pion

eer life, however, the colony made progress.

One of the first things that the colony did,

 under the leadership of Oscar
Johnson, was to provide schools. The public school, in the 

early years of the
colony, was conducted in what is now the office of Oscar Johnson. It co

ntinued
there until 1904, when the present school building was erected. The site for the
s

chool and lumber for the building were provided by the colonization company,
and the labor

 was performed by the settlers themselves/ thus, what was then a
good school house was pro

vided. The county and the state at that time did not
provide sufficient funds to carry on 

the school more than four or five months in
the year. The Scandinavian settlers, most of w

hom were born in Scandinavia, were
not satisfied with so short a term for their children, 

so they voluntarily
agreed to tax themselves per family in order to provide a school term 

of eight
months a year.

The colonization company assisted by giving sites and lumber from

 their sawmill.
Soon the colony had grown to such an extent that it was possible to have a


minister stationed in the community. The first church established was the
Baptist, and af

ter that the so/called Mission church, which is an offspring of
the Lutheran Church. Many 

of the settlers were Lutherans, so it was not long
before the Augustana Synod showed its i

nterest in the community by sending
missionaries. Services were held in the schoolhouse. I

n recent years a neat
Lutheran Church has been built in Silverhill, with the aid of the co

lonization
company, which donated a site for the church as well as otherwise assisting. A


permanent minister has been maintained by the Lutheran congregation for many
years past. T

here is also an elementary school located in Silverhill called
Silverhill Elementary, it i

s a very good school with very well/educated
teachers, and over the summer of 2006 they ar

e adding a 1.5 million dollar
building to the school, and are now going to have 6th grade 

at Silverhill
Elementary.

The settlers early realized the possibilities for dairying, and

 John Ca/>alvin Co<lidge Jr.   July 4 1872 />  ndash  January 5 1933 , known prim<arily
as  Calvin Coolidge , was the 30th/> President of the United States  <1923   1929 />.
A <lawyer from Vermont, Coolidge worked/>d his wa<y/> up the ladder of Massachuset<ts/>
state politics, eventually<becoming governor of that state. His />actions during
the Boston Police St<r/>ike of <919 thrust him into the national spotl/>light. He was
elected as the 29t<h V/>ice President<in 1920 and succeeded to /> the Presidency upon
the deat< of Warren G/>. Harding. He <was elected i/>in his own <right in 1924, and
gained a reputat/>ion as a small government con<ervative.

In many ways, Coolidge s/>s style< of governance was a throwback to the />passive
Presidenc<y of the nineteent/>th century. ref<Sobel, 14 /ref  He restored public/>c
c<nfidence in the White Hou/>se after the scandals of his predeces<sor s
administration, and left off/>ice with considerable popularity. r<f McCoy,

most convincing pro/>of <of his strength.  ref Fues/>ss, 500 /ref
