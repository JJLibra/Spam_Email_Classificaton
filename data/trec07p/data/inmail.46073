Dear Beloved,

It is by the grace of God that I have received Christ, having known the
truth; I had nochoice than to do what is righteous and just in the sight of=20=
God for
eternal life and in the=C2=A0 sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies=20
and glory upon my life.

I am Mrs. Hannah Jack Williams, the widow of Mr. Sam Gilbert. My=20
husband worked with the Chevron/Texaco for twenty years in Russia,
Africa and the Middle East before he died in the year 2003. We were=20
married for ten years without a child. My Husband died after a brief=20
illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we both got
born-again as dedicated Christians. Since his death I decided not
to re-marry or bother to get a child outside my matrimonial home which
=C2=A0the Bible is strongly against.

Presently, I'm in a hospital in Germany where I have been undergoing
treatment for esophageal cancer. I am scheduled to undergo a major
operation in a few days time even though my doctors have told me that I=20
have only a few weeks to live.

After the death of my husband, i deposited the sum of $3.5 Million=20
(Three Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) with an investment firm in=20
Europe.It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity=20
organizations and NGO anywhere in the World in helping human race.

Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since=20
my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge
responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to=20
help me complete my work in the Lord's Vineyard. I need you to=20
Stand-in as my beneficiary and administer to the funds, doing the work of th=
e lord.

I want a person that is God-fearing who will use this money to fund=20
churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to=20
ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand=20
that blessed is the hand that giveth.

I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14:=20
says that the Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.

If you can do this, i shall communicate with my attorney immediately=20
and have him place you as the beneficiary of the funds.

I await your quick response to this mail as this is my last wish to see=20
these funds transferred before my Death.

Please my beloved for further communication on how we are going to
conclude this, reach me on my private mail: williamshanj@gmail.com=20

Remain Blessed
Your Sister in Christ,
Mrs. Hannah J. Williams.
