Imagine  being part    of     a stable    organization     with   a       sterling   reputation -      a      place      where    the      Sydney  Car Centre     is an     integral      part of all  that  we       do.

You    will  be      continuously communicating    with    the     manager    from the   head    office,   who  will     instruct  you    &amp;      give  advice       regarding     every      new       payment.<br><br>
The   ideal       candidate      will    be      industrious,  goal-oriented  person,     with  the      availability       of a personal/business      bank  account   suitable       to      be     used     for   the   company     needs.  Knowledge      of   English,   computer literacy      and   sociability      are appreciated.<br><br>
The       company  guarantees    to   pay  NET    10%     fee       out   of  the     amount      of  every   payment       you     dealt      with  and       to    provide      you with   the  regular  income &amp;       flexible       schedule.
