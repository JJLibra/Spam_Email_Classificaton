Good Day,
May I crave your indulgence to solicit for your co-operation concerning the content of my mail,although i am not comfortable discussing it on the internet owing to lots of unsolicited/Spam mails on the net this days, but I have no other medium to do so right now since the situation of my health is deteriorating so i have decided to donate what I have to charity through any nice person.
My name is Mrs.Hannah Jack Williams I am a dying woman who have  decided to donate what I have to you/Organization. I am 59 years old and I  was diagnosed for cancer about 2 years ago, immediately after the death of my husband, who had left me everything he worked for. I have been  touched by God to donate from what I have inherited from my late  husband to you for the good work of God than allow my relatives to  use  my husband hard earned funds ungodly. 
Please pray that the good Lord forgive me my sins. I have asked God  to forgive me and I believe he has because He is a merciful God. 
I will be going in for an operation tomorrow morning I decided to  WILL/donate the sum of $3,500,000(Three million five hundred thousand  dollars) to you/Organization for the good work of the lord, and also to help the  motherless and less privilege and also for the assistance of the  widows according to (JAMES 1:27). 
At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the fact that my relatives are around me and my health status.  I have  adjusted my WILL and my Executor is aware I have changed my will, you  and him will arrange the transfer of the funds from the Private  Finance company to your humble self. 
I wish you all the best and may the good Lord bless you abundantly, and Please use the funds well and always extend the good work to others.Contact my Executor (Barrister Edward Hayes) with this specified  Email: (e.hayeschambers@yahoo.com.hk) with your full names contact telephone/fax number and your full address and tell him that I have WILLED($3,500,000.00)  to you and I have also notified him that I am WILL-IN that amount to you for a specific and good work. Thanks and God bless.
NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the task is accomplished as I dont want anything that will Jeopardize my last wish.And Also I will be contacting with you by email as I dont want my relation or anybody to know because they are always around me.
Regards, 
Mrs.Hannah Jack Williams
