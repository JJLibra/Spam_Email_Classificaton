The term  university college  is used in a number of countries to denote
institutions that provide tertiary education but do not have full or independent
university status. A university college is often part of a larger university.
Precise usage varies between countries.

Australia In Australia, the term  university college  was used to refer to
educational institutions that were like universities, but lacked full autonomy.
The  Latrobe University College of Northern Victoria  was one such college.
University colleges existing today generally cater for specific subjects  such
as Theology, or the Arts . Avondale College, located in Cooranbong, NSW, offers
the widest range of degree subjects for a Denominational school in the country.

Additionally, some residential colleges associated with universities are named
 University College .

Residential colleges are common Australian institutions which primarily provide
accommodation to students, though may also provide academic support  such as
tutorials  and social activities to residents.

University College, Melbourne, formerly University Women s College, is one such
residential college. It is affiliated with the University of Melbourne.

Canada In Canada,  university college  has three meanings  a degree granting
institution  an institution that offers university level coursework  or a
University of Toronto and Laurentian University college.

 University college  can refer to institutions that offer both college diplomas
and undergraduate degrees. In British Columbia, many university colleges serve
as both universities and vocational or technical colleges  some grant graduate
degrees and operate research programs and institutes.

The title  university college  is extensively used by institutions that do not
have full university status, but which do extensive teaching at degree level.
The title  university  is protected by federal law in Canada, but the title
 college  is only regulated in some Canadian provinces. Some Canadian university
colleges are public institutions, some are private  some are regulated by
government agencies, others are not. Information about the status of particular
institutions can be found at the CICIC web site listed below. Institutions that
are members of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada  AUCC  can
be generally be accepted as providing university level programs.

 University College  is also the name of a Canadian educational institution.
University College is the name of a constituent college of the University of
Toronto.

Ireland The National University of Ireland and Queen s University Belfast were
based on the UK university college system both set up in 1908 before the
establishment of the Republic of Ireland and having roots in the earlier Queen s
University of Ireland which was also a university college type system. The
university colleges of the National University have since been raised to the
status of universities   as they were considered for many years before statute
recognition   but the system still maintains its overall federal status. Queen s
University Belfast initially had no university colleges and the first university
college was created in 1985  St Mary s  and second in 1999  Stranmillis , these
two institutions previously were associated with the university, offering its
degrees since 1968.

New Zealand Nearly all New Zealand universities were originally described as
 University colleges , and were constituent parts of a federal body, the
University of New Zealand. All are now fully independent  thus the former
Canterbury University College is now the University of Canterbury.

There is a specific university hall of residence named  University College  at
Otago University.

Sweden and Norway In Sweden and Norway,  University College  is the recognised
translation into English of the Swedish term [[h  gskola]] or the Norwegian term
[[h  gskole]], which denotes an independent institution that provides tertiary
but not quaternary education. In contrast to universities they do not themselves
conduct research or generally grant degrees above bachelor. They can however
participate in research projects which are under the supervisory authority of a
university. Under special dispensation they may also award a limited number of
master s degrees.

 University College  is the proper terminology to use, since a literal
translation of the term h  gskola or h  gskole would be  high school , and as
such misleading. However, as many of the university colleges aspire to full
university status, several have chosen to omit the word college when translating
their names to English. This can make it difficult to distinguish the Swedish
and Norwegian universities proper from the university colleges.

In Sweden, the term h  gskola is also used by a number of specialised
universities, especially the technical universities, which provide both tertiary
and quaternary education, as well as conduct research. These are not considered
as un</STYLE>
