Does Your Multi Vitamin Measure Up?
Even if you try your best to eat well every day, the healthiest diets
can still lack the right levels of vitamins. That’s why prestigious
educational institutions and medical journals recommend a daily
multivitamin for all adults. 

Unfortunately, not all multivitamins are the same. 

What’s wrong with most multi vitamins? 
1. The tablets or rock-hard capsules are difficult to swallow, which
prevents people from taking them regularly.
2. Many multi vitamins are filled with binders and fillers that cause
poor absorption.
3. Few multi vitamins are formulated with beneficial plant-based
nutrients.

The good news? 12-in-One Soft Gel Multi can help!
 
To get the nutrients your body needs, don’t waste your money on a
typical multi-vitamin. 12-in-One Soft-Gel Multi helps nourish your body
with more than 117 nutrients, 72 trace minerals and 47 fruit and
vegetable concentrates. 

Designed in a soft-gel formula that’s both easy to swallow and
fast-absorbing, 12-in-One features premium ingredients from all 12 key
nutrient groups that your body needs to thrive. Plus, there are no
binders and fillers to prevent your body from absorbing the essential
amino acid blend, crucial oil complex and green super foods needed for
optimal health.

for 30 Days!
