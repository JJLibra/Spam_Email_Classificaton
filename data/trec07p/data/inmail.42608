 George Walker Bush   born July 6, 1946  is the 43rd and current President of
the United States of America, inaugurated on January 20, 2001. The oldest son of
former United States President George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush was elected
president himself in the 2000 general election. Previously, Bush had been
serving as the 46th governor of Texas since 1995. Bush was reelected in 2004 as
president.

Bush worked in his family s oil businesses following college. In 1978, he made
an unsuccessful run for the U.S. House of Representatives. He later co owned the
Texas Rangers baseball team before returning to politics in a campaign for
Governor of Texas. He defeated Ann Richards and was elected as Governor in 1994,
serving until his successful campaign for president.

Bush won the presidency in 2000 as the Republican candidate in a close and
controversial contest. Although he lost the popular vote, the Supreme Court
decision in [[Bush v. Gore]] gave Bush the required number of electoral votes
with a 537 vote margin in the state of Florida. As President, Bush pushed
through a $1.3 trillion tax cut program and the No Child Left Behind Act, and
has also pushed for socially conservative efforts such as the Partial Birth
Abortion Ban Act and faith based welfare initiatives.

After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Bush declared a global [[War
on Terrorism]] and ordered an invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban,
destroy Al Qaeda and to capture Osama bin Laden in October 2001. In March 2003,
Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq, asserting that Iraq was in violation of UN
Security Council Resolution 1441, that  further diplomatic and other peaceful
means alone [would not] adequately protect the national security of the United
States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq  and that the invasion was
 consistent with the United States ... continuing to take the necessary actions
against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those
nations, organizations, or persons who planned, authorized, committed, or aided
the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11,
2001.  ref  /ref  ref  /ref

re election, Bush received increasingly heated criticism, even from former

decreased ref [http //www.pollingreport.com/BushJob.htm Pollingreport.com  
PRESIDENT BUSH     Overall Job Rating in recent national polls] /ref  due to the
war and other issues such as the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, the NSA
warrantless surveillance controversy, and the record budget deficits affecting
the administration. By early 2007, three years into his second term, he had
already lost control of Congress to the opposition party, although he wields the
veto pen. With an unprecedented early start for the 2008 presidential campaign
season already underway, his Presidency will play a very large role in shaping
not only the future of America, but the future of the Middle East as well, as
the Iraq War will be his legacy.

Childhood to mid life



Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Bush was the first child of George H. W. Bush
and Barbara Bush. Bush was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with his four
siblings, Jeb, Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy. Another younger sister, Robin, died in
1953 at the age of three from leukemia. ref   cite web

History Babson College was founded by Roger Babson on September 3, 

1919, as the
/Babson Institute./ It was renamed /Babson College/ in 1969.

In 1992, the ra

dical new curriculum of Babson/s Graduate School of Business made
headlines in the Boston 

Globe, which wrote that in fall of 1993 the school
//will scrap its first/year curriculum,

 throwing out traditional courses such as
/marketing, organizational behavior and finance.

 In their place will be five
/sequential /modules/ that track the life of a typical busine

ss/ students will
/be taught functional skills only when they need them to solve a particu

lar
/problem/mdash/a /just in time/ approach to learning./

Undergraduate program The unde

rgraduate curriculum integrates business
disciplines and liberal arts into foundation, int

ermediate, and advanced/level
courses. All first/year students participate in the Foundati

on Management
Experience/FME/, a yearlong immersion into the world of business where stude

nt
teams create their own for/profit ventures. At the completion of FME, the
businesses ar

e liquidated and any profits are donated to a charity of choice.
Babson teaches accounting

, marketing, finance, management operations,
organizational behavior, strategy and economi

cs in one integrated, three/
semester course sequence known as Intermediate Management Exp

erience /IME/. As
part of the Advanced Program, students design their own learning plans, 

which
can consist of upper/level elective courses in liberal arts and management, field/
b

ased experiences, and cocurricular activities.

Graduate program Babson features four degr

ee programs, all using Babson/s
modular approach and emphasizing the practical application

 of business ideas.
/Two/Year MBA program/ it includes field/based experience working on b

usiness
problems for client companies. /One/Year MBA Program/ an accelerated full/time
MBA

 program is for students with an undergraduate business degree and at least
two years of p

ost/graduate work. /Evening MBA program/ its eight/course core
includes four cross/discipl

inary classes that teach holistic thinking about
complex management situations. /Fast Trac

k MBA Program/ In January 2003, Babson
introduced a part/time program combining traditiona

l classroom instruction with
Web/based, distance learning. The program can be completed in

 24 months.
Students attend classes on/campus during intensive, two/and/a/half day session

s
once each month. /Executive education/ Babson Executive Education offerings
include cust

om programs, open enrollment programs, consortium programs, applied
research centers.
