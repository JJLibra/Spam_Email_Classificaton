The
  next unless /^(\S+)/;
serves two purposes. First it makes sure you do not try to process 
lines that are empty or start with whitespace (whether that's likely 
to happen or not I have no idea) and it captures the first "word" 
from the line so that you can access it via $1.

The magic is in the regular expression

  /^(\S+)/

The \S means "any character except whitespace, the + means one or 
more such characters, the () mean that you are interested in those 
characters and the ^ means that you are searching for thise non-
whitespace characters in the beginning of the string only.

So that line could be read as

  go read the next line if the current one doesn't start with non-
whitespace characters. If it does, remember them in $1.
