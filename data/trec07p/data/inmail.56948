<p align="right"><b>June 13, 2007</b></p>
<p>Fellow Investor,</p>
<p>While Wall Street was partying like it was 1999 all over again&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;I was warning my Trending123 subscribers &ndash; and anyone else who would listen &ndash; about the &ldquo;coming crash.&rdquo;&nbsp; I closed all our long-side trades &ndash; took our substantial profits &ndash; and warned everyone to hunker down until the storm clouds cleared.</p>
<p>Now &ndash; with the Dow DOWN more than 400 points at times last week, and continued volatility, I&rsquo;m getting a lot of &ldquo;thank-yous&rdquo; thrown my way.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not resting on my laurels.&nbsp; The worst isn&rsquo;t over &ndash; not by a long shot.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I have an urgent video presentation for you to watch now.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll see, all the market charts &ndash; from the NASDAQ&rsquo;s &ldquo;QQQQ&rdquo; to the S&amp;P 500, and so on &ndash; point to an impending calamity for most investors.&nbsp; The Dow could drop as much as 2,000 points from its highs before it&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>Stand in the way and you will be crushed.<br><a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CRJLTRPYPC-3317975-8FP187-8FP187-IPLACEREPORTS@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA"><img align="right" src="http://images.investorplace.com/e_images/jltr/protectyourself/jltr_dgbbts_join03.jpg" width="100" height="100" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Why should you listen to what I say?&nbsp;  First of all, it&rsquo;ll only take a few minutes of your time, but could save you many thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll learn how to protect your portfolio &mdash; even how to profit through the plunge, as other investors lose their shirts.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, I have a history with events like this.&nbsp;  I started my <em>Trending123</em> trading service back in 1999 precisely to warn people about the impending NASDAQ meltdown.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s profits you&rsquo;re looking for, consider this: At <em>Trending123</em>, we have closed 67 short-term trades so far this year, and 78% of them have been winning trades.&nbsp;  On an annualized basis, we&rsquo;re averaged 114% gains on each one of those trades!</p>
<p>So please, take just a few minutes now to hear me out.&nbsp;  You owe it to yourself to at least consider what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
