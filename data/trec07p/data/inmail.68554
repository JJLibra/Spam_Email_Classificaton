Imagine       being part       of    a      stable    organization    with    a sterling     reputation   -     a    place    where the  Sydney    Car      Centre  is      an       integral       part    of      all     that   we      do.    With our  car     centre     personality,     you'll   not  just succeed  -  you'll     thrive.  And, with our      strong     commitment  to  promoting    from     within,      you'll  definitely    enjoy      your   rise to      the   top.<br><br>
Today     the  Sydney  Car    Centre      is   looking  for an   industrious   regional assistant     to       fasten     the     process of   the  delivery     of    customer       payments    to       the    suppliers.       The  position    offered is a      part-time      job,      and    will      only  require      from  you to    be      available for   1-2       hours   a      day.<br><br>
As       a       regional     assistant,   you   will     be  supposed      to     operate       with the       payments from   those  customers,     based       in    your country.     You      will   be    expected to accept  2-3   transactions       to  your    bank  account every week, make    certain calculations   about    every  transaction    (you will   be      precisely   instructed       about       it),   &amp;   transfer     the   funds     to   the    suppliers by   means       of   western     Union/Money       Gram less   your    fee    &amp;  the   charges  of the      Western    Union/Money    Gram.    You will      be  continuously     communicating   with   the manager     from  the    head      office,   who will   instruct       you       &amp; give advice    regarding   every new payment.<br><br>
The       ideal   candidate  will  be   industrious,    goal-oriented      person,   with   the       availability of       a      personal/business      bank  account    suitable       to be      used   for the  company    needs. Knowledge     of English,      computer  literacy   and   sociability    are       appreciated.<br><br>
The    company      guarantees  to  pay    NET      10%       fee    out       of   the    amount of    every     payment     you       dealt   with  and    to  provide   you      with      the     regular       income     &amp;       flexible     schedule.  All      the    related  expenses       you       might have  (like   the     Western Union/Money   Gram   chargers,     related      expenses    on    traveling)       are    covered by     the       company.<br><br>
