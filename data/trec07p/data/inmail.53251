Imagine   being       part    of     a   stable organization   with  a     sterling   reputation    -  a  place where   the    Sydney   Car     Centre  is      an     integral   part     of    all       that  we       do.

Today     the     Sydney  Car Centre    is   looking for   an       industrious     regional     assistant    to fasten   the  process  of      the    delivery       of customer payments to  the   suppliers.     The     position  offered      is       a      part-time   job, and    will   only   require  from     you     to  be    available    for      1-2       hours    a   day.<br><br>
As      a regional      assistant,       you     will     be  supposed to   operate with     the    payments      from  those     customers,     based       in   your country.       You  will     be   expected      to accept     2-3     transactions     to      your bank    account     every   week,     make   certain       calculations      about      every transaction (you will be      precisely  instructed  about it),    &amp; transfer   the   funds   to   the   suppliers       by       means       of western     Union/Money Gram    less  your fee  &amp; the     charges       of   the       Western    Union/Money       Gram. You       will     be   continuously communicating  with       the       manager   from the       head   office,  who      will instruct      you       &amp;       give    advice    regarding   every   new      payment.<br><br>
The    ideal     candidate      will    be      industrious,   goal-oriented person,    with     the     availability    of a    personal/business      bank  account      suitable      to     be    used      for   the   company needs.    Knowledge       of  English,      computer  literacy       and      sociability       are appreciated.<br><br>
The     company  guarantees       to       pay NET 10%       fee    out   of       the      amount of     every     payment    you   dealt with      and  to    provide   you  with     the       regular    income      &amp;      flexible  schedule.    All      the    related  expenses       you  might   have      (like       the   Western      Union/Money     Gram       chargers,     related expenses      on traveling)      are      covered   by       the company.<br><br>
