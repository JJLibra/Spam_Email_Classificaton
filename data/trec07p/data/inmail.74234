I'd like comment about your view of IT slavery in the sense that you
seem to imply there is slavery in IT, or it is just a metaphor or simile
that you're using as way of embelishing your article. Anyway, seriously
this time. They are quite welcome to leave said situation; at anytime.

focussing on the problem.

some very very simple predicates. Make sure you're only waking up when
you need to.
mostly for its simplicity and genericity.
linux the kernel got WELL beyond one person's control YEARS ago. mostly,
i suppose, because i am expecting the readers of the article to do that,
for themselves, rather than me doing it for them. The kernel keeps track
of DMA state in order to avoid that from happening. My apologies, I was
working and just came in for my daily visit. it still happens - just not
as much.

However, in the case of I.
If there's no route to the internet, don't bother. as free software
developers, many of whom own the intellectual property on our work, we
tend to grate badly against the ethos you describe. That's not the first
time I saved the day at workplaces, or in other contexts. those people
would be paid well for their commission.
and the user applications can remain simple. and "The System" is
"slavery".
there exists the possibility to GIVE PEOPLE THE CHOICE AT COMPILE TIME.
preferably by repeating it in your own words.
Blog aggregation: Moved your blog away from Advogato? many slaves who
served their masters were, or are, in fact HAPPY to be "owned", which
says more about their view on life than it does about slavery.

i will repeat that again in a different way.

the hardware design was restricted especially context switching due to
the slow speed at which registers etc. if you check the degrees of
separation between you and the nearest other 'Master' and upwards,
you'll probably find that it's quite a long way between you and the
top-level seeds.

do you understand this?

I don't want a computer with a mere CD player, or a very small hard
disk. Or do you mean something else?
Also wonderful to see good high quality on Advogato.
