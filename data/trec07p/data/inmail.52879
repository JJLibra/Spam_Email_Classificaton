Hi

My name is kerri. I found your email on that dating site.
I also love sex on the side. I have a loving partner but he is working 16 hours a day and we have sex only once a week :(
If you are interested and wanna see my pictures just email me at ckerri183@mailcreativity.info
Don`t reply, use the email above (my boyfriend doesn`t know about that email!)
