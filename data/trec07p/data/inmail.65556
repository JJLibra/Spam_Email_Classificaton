In some countries, class rankings are posted on the wall as early as first grade. I met a woman once who said her whole life changed after her family moved to Canada: it gave her an out from the South Korean school system. Here, you can graduate high school without knowing how to spell correctly or multiply in your head.  Nonetheless, there are plenty of curiosities for the lay reader.  I can smell it.

The 3-D animation, part of a Purdue study that took two and a half years to complete, will hopefully help engineers design safer buildings, researchers said. "Using one particle to detect and destroy tumours could cut treatment length"Since optical coherence tomography only penetrates up to 2 millimetres, the imaging step will only be useful for locating tumours near the surface, such as cervical, mouth and skin cancers, says Gobin. However, the team plans to modify the nanoshells so that they work with more deeply penetrating radiation, such as X-rays. Houston-based Nanospectra Biosciences, which West co-founded, will begin trials of the spheres in humans in the next two months. She noted that Western consumers use products made in China.
