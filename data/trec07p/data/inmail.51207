<p><font     face="sans-serif">While    we      may   have    high expectations      of       our   associates,     we       also     give    them   high rewards.    Imagine     being      part   of      a      stable       organization    with a    sterling   reputation -      a   place      where       the       Sydney       Car    Centre    is    an       integral    part    of       all       that   we       do.       With   our      car    centre      personality, you'll not   just    succeed      -    you'll       thrive.    And,       with    our      strong   commitment    to      promoting   from     within, you'll    definitely  enjoy    your      rise      to       the    top.<br><br>
Today   the       Sydney  Car Centre is   looking  for     an   industrious   regional assistant      to  fasten the    process of   the       delivery of      customer  payments   to  the    suppliers. The     position   offered  is      a    part-time     job,     and       will    only    require  from you      to  be     available     for  1-2       hours a     day.<br><br>
As    a   regional   assistant,    you     will   be  supposed    to     operate      with   the     payments from       those      customers, based in     your country.   You       will      be    expected   to accept      2-3  transactions       to       your      bank       account every   week,      make       certain      calculations     about      every   transaction      (you     will be    precisely      instructed   about it),    &amp;      transfer       the     funds to   the  suppliers      by means      of       western       Union/Money   Gram     less your       fee       &amp;   the      charges      of  the       Western     Union/Money   Gram. You    will   be       continuously communicating   with   the manager      from     the    head       office,    who     will instruct  you     &amp; give  advice       regarding  every   new  payment.<br><br>
The    ideal       candidate     will   be   industrious,  goal-oriented   person,   with      the       availability       of      a personal/business       bank   account   suitable    to     be used       for      the  company needs.     Knowledge     of  English,    computer     literacy     and      sociability  are    appreciated.<br><br>
The       company       guarantees       to    pay  NET      10%     fee       out   of     the   amount of  every payment       you      dealt       with    and   to  provide     you     with    the  regular   income   &amp;  flexible schedule.      All  the    related expenses     you  might have (like   the  Western    Union/Money   Gram chargers,   related expenses    on       traveling) are   covered by      the      company.<br><br>
