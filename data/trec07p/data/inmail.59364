Evolution

The phylogeny of snakes is poorly known due to the fact that snake skeletons are
typically small and fragile, making fossilization unlikely. It has however been
generally agreed, on the basis of morphology, that snakes descended from lizard 
like ancestors. Recent research based on genetics and biochemistry confirms
this  snakes form a venom clade with several extant lizard families.

Recent fossil evidence suggests that snakes directly evolved from burrowing
lizards, either varanids or some other group. An early fossil snake, [[Najash
rionegrina]], was a two legged burrowing animal with a sacrum, fully
terrestrial. One extant analog of these putative ancestors is the earless
monitor [[Lanthanotidae Lanthanotus]] of Borneo, although it also is semi 
aquatic. As these ancestors became more subterranean, they lost their limbs and
became more streamlined for burrowing. Features such as the transparent, fused
eyelids  brille  and loss of external ears, according to this hypothesis,
evolved to combat subterranean conditions  scratched corneas, dirt in the ears .
According to this hypothesis, snakes re emerged onto the surface of the land
much as they are today. Other primitive snakes are known to have possessed
hindlimbs but lacked a direct connection of the pelvic bones to the vertebrae,
including [[Haasiophis]], [[Pachyrhach</STYLE>

The /College of

 the Holy Cross/ is an exclusively undergraduate Roman Catholic
liberal arts college locat

ed in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA. Holy Cross is the
oldest Roman Catholic college in Ne

w England and one of the oldest in the United
States.

Opened as a school for boys under t

he auspices of the Society of Jesus, it was
the first Jesuit college in New England. Today

, Holy Cross is one of 28 member
institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Un

iversities and is part
of a consortium with other Worcester colleges, including Worcester 

Polytechnic
Institute and Clark University. On July 1, 2000, Rev. Michael C. McFarland, S.

J.
became the current president of the college. As of February 2007, the Holy Cross
endowm

ent was valued at $544 million./ref name//glance/ //
