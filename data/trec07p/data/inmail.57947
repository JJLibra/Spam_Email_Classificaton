 Why should you try Viagra?

Why Viagra? ...because that look she gives is only meant for you... because
an empty nest is the chance to fall in love all over again... because reading
the Sunday paper doesnt take all day.

If you have ED, youve already got plenty of reasons to choose Viagra, 
but here are some more that you should know about.
