Drug Coated Stents - Health Alert Newsletter - May 7th, 2007  



The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, have cited studies showing 

that drug-coated stent recipients face an increased risk of blood-clots. 



Drug-coated stents, which are sold in the U.S. by Boston Scientific and 

Johnson & Johnson, are designed to prevent scar tissue from forming in 

arteries after angioplasty. However, recent studies have suggested 

the devices might increase the risk of blood clots compared with bare-metal stents.



Drug-coated stents have been placed in about 6 million people worldwide. 



If you or someone you know has had a drug-coated stent implanted they may be at risk. 

If so, you or that someone may be entitled to monetary damages.
