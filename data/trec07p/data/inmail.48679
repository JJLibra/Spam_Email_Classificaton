<STYLE> There are other uses for the term [[Cobden]].


 Richard Cobden   June 3, 1804  ndash  April 2, 1865  was a British manufacturer
and Radical and Liberal statesman, associated with John Bright in the formation
of the Anti Corn Law League.

Early years Cobden was born at a farmhouse called Dunford, in Heyshott near
Midhurst, in Sussex. His family had been resident in that neighbourhood for many
generations, occupied partly in trade and partly in agriculture. His grandfather
owned Bex Mill in Heyshott and was a maltster, an energetic and prosperous man
who served as bailiff and chief magistrate, taking rather a notable part in
county matters. His father, forsaking malting, took to farming. A poor business
man, he died while Richard was a child.

The family returned to Midhurst where Cobden attended a dame school and then
Bowes Hall School in Teesdale, Yorkshire. When fifteen years of age he went to
London to the warehouse business of his uncle Richard Ware Cole where he became
a commercial traveller in muslin and calico. His relative, noting the lad s
passionate addiction to study, solemnly warned him against indulging such a
taste, as likely to prove a fatal obstacle to his success in commercial life.
Cobden was undeterred and made good use of the library of the London
Institution. When his uncle s business failed, he joined that of Partridge  
Price, in Eastcheap, one of the partners being his uncle s former partner.

In 1828, Cobden set up his own business with Sheriff and Gillet, partly with
capital from John Lewis, acting as London agents for Fort Brothers,</STYLE>

A /dragonfly/ is any i

nsect belonging to the order Odonata, the suborder
Epiprocta or, in the strict sense, the 

infraorder /Anisoptera/. It is
characterized by large multifaceted eyes, two pairs of stro

ng transparent wings,
and an elongated body.

Dragonflies typically eat mosquitoes, midges

 and other small insects like flies,
bees, and butterflies. They are usually found around 

lakes, ponds, streams, and
wetlands because their larvae, known as /nymphs/, are aquatic. 

Dragonflies do
not normally bite or sting humans /though they will bite in order to escape

, for
example, if grasped by the abdomen// in fact, they are valued as a predator that
hel

ps control the populations of harmful insects, such as mosquitoes. It is
because of this t

hat dragonflies are sometimes called /mosquito hawks/ in North
America.

Life cycle


The 

life cycle of the dragonfly, from egg to death of adult, varies from six
months to as much

 as six or seven years. Female dragonflies lay eggs in or near
water, often in or on float

ing or emergent plants. Most of the life cycle is
spent in the larval /naiad, aka nymph/ f
