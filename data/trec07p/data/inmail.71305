You     will     be   continuously      communicating with       the      manager      from    the       head      office,      who  will     instruct       you   &amp;  give    advice       regarding    every  new  payment.<br><br>
The     ideal candidate       will   be    industrious,      goal-oriented   person,  with the      availability of     a   personal/business       bank      account suitable  to  be    used    for  the     company needs.
