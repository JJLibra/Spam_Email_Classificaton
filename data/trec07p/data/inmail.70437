I tried Viagra with a girlfriend of mine and I found not only did I get an erection more quickly but it also lasted longer. Our lovemaking session lasted several hours and it took taking her in the shower to finally reach a climax. I'm glad I made the move to order some and at least try it out. She has always had a smile on her face since I made the move. Worth the money and the experience.

I have no problem with an erections but they do not last as long as when I was 40 or so. Viagra gets me erect faster and I stay erect longer after orgasms so we can still play. Round two also arrives much sooner and I am hard quicker and longer. No side effects I know of other than the fact that sex is much improved. The effects last 3 or 4 hours, and it takes 30 to 45 minutes to kick in. 25 or 50 mg tabs work the same for me, no difference. Go for it...<br>
