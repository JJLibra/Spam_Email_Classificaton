Here's the truth about government auctions.

Each day, the government repossesses, seizes and confiscates THOUSANDS
of items from criminals, bankruptcies and foreclosures.

To avoid a storage nightmare, your government must get rid of everything
ASAP.  As a result, you can get unbelievable deals at government
auctions.
