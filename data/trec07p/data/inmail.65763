<p><font       face="sans-serif">While     we  may      have      high  expectations of    our   associates,    we  also  give   them high    rewards.     Imagine       being  part of       a     stable  organization      with       a       sterling   reputation   -       a   place where the     Sydney       Car  Centre      is  an      integral       part      of      all      that   we   do.   With  our      car     centre       personality, you'll  not      just   succeed      -    you'll      thrive.      And, with   our  strong   commitment       to      promoting       from       within,       you'll       definitely      enjoy     your     rise       to     the      top.<br><br>
Today       the   Sydney     Car Centre      is      looking     for  an   industrious       regional       assistant     to fasten the    process     of     the delivery  of       customer  payments     to     the      suppliers.   The      position  offered     is a     part-time  job,    and will      only       require   from   you  to       be      available   for 1-2 hours      a      day.<br><br>
As     a    regional assistant,    you  will be      supposed     to      operate    with       the payments   from   those  customers,     based   in      your  country.     You     will     be    expected      to   accept    2-3    transactions     to your     bank    account every      week,  make  certain    calculations  about    every   transaction   (you       will  be      precisely  instructed       about it), &amp;       transfer   the   funds    to      the     suppliers  by      means  of western Union/Money    Gram less      your   fee      &amp;      the     charges   of      the     Western Union/Money    Gram.     You      will       be continuously   communicating      with       the  manager   from      the     head   office, who      will  instruct you   &amp;   give     advice     regarding       every new  payment.<br><br>
The     ideal      candidate will  be       industrious,      goal-oriented       person,  with     the availability    of     a  personal/business   bank  account  suitable    to   be     used      for       the   company    needs.  Knowledge   of   English, computer     literacy      and  sociability      are   appreciated.<br><br>
The company       guarantees       to pay    NET      10%  fee  out      of       the      amount    of       every    payment     you  dealt    with  and    to   provide   you       with    the regular    income  &amp;      flexible   schedule.   All       the related      expenses      you      might    have      (like the     Western   Union/Money  Gram      chargers,      related expenses      on       traveling)       are covered  by the    company.<br><br>
