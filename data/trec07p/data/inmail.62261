 Sim  n Jos   Antonio de la Sant  sima Trinidad Bol  var y Palacios   born July
24, 1783 in Caracas, Venezuela  died December 17, 1830, in Santa Marta,
Colombia  was a leader of several independence movements throughout South
America, collectively known as Bol  var s War.

Credited with leading the fight for independence in what are now the countries
of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, and Bolivia, he is revered as a
hero in these countries and throughout much of the rest of Hispanic America.

In 1802, he married Mar  a Teresa Rodr  guez del Toro y Alaysa. She died of
yellow fever less than a year later and he never remarried.

Bol  var is known as  El Libertador   the Liberator .

Family heritage and early life The Bol  var aristocratic bloodline derives from
a small village in the Basque Country, called Bolibar, which is the origin of
the surname[http   www.guiabizkaia.com museos Bolibar Index.html]. His father
descended remotely from King Fernando III of Castile and Count Amedeo IV of
Savoy, and was provenient in male line of the family de
Ardanza. ref http   genealogia.netopia.pt pessoas pes_show.php?id 276543  ref 
The Bolivars settled in Venezuela in the sixteenth century.

A portion of their wealth came from the Aroa River gold and copper mines in
Venezuela. In 1632, gold was first mined, leading to further discoveries of
extensive copper deposits. Towards the later 1600s, copper was exploited with
the name  Cobre Caracas . These mines became the property of Sim  n Bol  var s
family. Later in his revolutionary life, Bol  var used part of the mineral
income to finance the South American revolutionary wars. Some people claim that
his family grew to prominence before gaining great wealth. For example, the
Cathedral of Caracas, founded in 1575, has a side chapel dedicated to Sim  n
Bol  var s family.

Bol  var was born in Caracas, in modern day Venezuela and educated by tutors
after his parents died. Among his tutors was Sim  n Rodr  guez, whose ideas and
educational style heavily influenced the young man.

Following the death of his father Juan Vicente de Bol  var y Ponte, 1st Marqu  s
de San Luis, and his mother Mar  a de la Concepci  n de Palacios y Blanco, he
went to Spain in 1799 to complete his education. There he married Mar  a Teresa
Rodr  guez del Toro y Alaysa in 1802, but on a brief return visit to Venezuela
in 1803, she succumbed to yellow fever. Bol  var returned to Europe in 1804 and
for a time was part of Napoleon s retinue.

Freemasonry

Simon Bolivar was a Freemason who was raised in the Scottish Rite, 1807. Simon
also founded the Lodge Order and Liberty No. 2 in Peru in
1824 ref http   freemasonry.bcy.ca biography bolivar_s bolivar_s.html Grand
Lodge of British Columbia   The Yukon  ref 

El Libertador Bol  var returned to Venezuela in 1807, and, when Napoleon made
Joseph Bonaparte King of Spain and its colonies in 1808, he participated in the
resistance juntas in South America. The Caracas junta declared its independence
in 1810, and Bol  var was sent to Britain on a diplomatic mission.

Bol  var returned to Venezuela in 1811. In March 1812, Bol  var was forced to
leave Venezuela because of an earthquake that destroyed Caracas. In July 1812,
junta leader Francisco de Miranda surrendered to the Spanish, and Bol  var had
to flee to Cartagena de Indias. In this period, Bol  var wrote his [[Cartagena
Manifesto/Manifiesto de Cartagena]]. In 1813, after acquiring a military command
in New Granada under the direction of the Congress of Tunja, he led the invasion
of Venezuela on May 14. This was the beginning of the famous Campa  a Admirable,
the Admirable Campaign. He entered M  rida on May 23, where he was proclaimed as
El Libertador, following the occupation of Trujillo on June 9. Six days later,
on June 15, he dictated his famous Decree of War to the Death  [[Decreto de
Guerra a Muerte]] . Caracas was retaken on August 6, 1813, and Bol  var was
ratified as  El Libertador , thus proclaiming the Venezuelan Second Republic.
Due to the rebellion of Jos   Tom  s Boves in 1814 and the fall of the republic,
he returned to New Granada, where he then commanded a Colombian nationalist
force and entered Bogot   in 1814, recapturing the city from the dissenting
republican forces of Cundinamarca. He intended to march into Cartagena and
enlist the aid of local forces in order to capture Royalist Santa Marta.
However, after a number of political and military disputes with the government
of Cartagena, Bol  var fled, in 1815, to Jamaica, where he petitioned the
Haitian leader Alexandre P  tion for aid.

In 1817, </STYLE>
