Under the terms of the deal, Peace Arch has agreed to acquire all of the shares of Dufferin Gate for approximately CAD$5.4 million in cash and CAD$!
600,000 of Peace Arch common stock. The acquisition is the latest validation of Peace Archs high-growth business model focused on the acquisition of profitable assets in the entertainment industry to create a fully integrated entertainment company.<br />

<br />
</font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Incorporated in July 1994, Dufferin Gate Productions has furnished production services on more than 150 cable movies, television series and feature films for such studios as Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Viacom Productions, Columbia/TriStar and Peace Arch, including such notable productions as the recent Showtime/Peace Arch collaboration The Tudors.<br />
<br />
</font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The privately-held company owns property and a 72,000 square foot building in Torontos West End, with state-of-the-art production and post-production facilities. The company had unaudited normalized EBITDA of approximately CAD$1 million for the year ending December 31, 2006.<br />
<br />
</font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">With its exemplary management, longstanding industry relationships and incomparable expertise in all aspects of the Canadian production industry, Dufferin Gate provides Peace Arch with a unique opportunity to expand our already robust production operations and provide more content to our rapidly growing distribution and sales divisions, said Gary Howsam, Chief Executive Officer of Peace Arch Entertainment. Dufferin Gate is a consistently profitable production service operation with highly valuable real estate. This facility will continue to offer to international productions a fully integrated base of operations in Canada, and give Peace Arch a fantastic opportunity to increase efficiencies and reduce costs on our own busy production schedule.<br />
<br />

</font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Peace Arch will immediately acquire 40.01% of the shares and 50% of the votes of Dufferin Gate. Peace Arch has escrowed funds to secure a put granted to the remaining shareholder, which upon exercise will provide for Peace Arch to acquire all of the remaining shares and votes.<br />
<br />
</font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"> This agreement with Peace Arch allows Dufferin Gate to expand its client-base and reliably increase its service activity with a steady supply of new productions, from both Peace Arch and its large contingent of international production and distribution partners, said John Weber, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dufferin Gate. With Peace Arch offices in Los Angeles, New York and Vancouver and an international sales team attending most major film and television markets, we believe the synergies offered by the combination of our two companies will make Dufferin Gate the service and facilities provider of choice for any production seeking to access the many benefits offered by the Canadian film and television industry.<br />
<br />
</font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Weber will remain President of Dufferin Gate, which will be renamed Peace Arch Studios, and continue to oversee its day-to-day operations. He also joins Peace Arch as Executive Vice President of Production.  He will report to Lewin Webb, President of Peace Archs production division.<br />
