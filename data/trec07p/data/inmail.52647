                             (OTCBB: CCBEF)

        Dear StockUpTicks Reader:

        A recent acquisition by a leading beverage company of
        an organic baby food producer would seem at first
        glance an odd pairing.  This may well have been the
        perspective of some investors when Clearly Canadian
        (OTCBB:CCBEF) announced that the company completed its
        acquisition of My Organic Baby, which has national
        distribution in Canada for its organic baby food
        products.

        But when you consider the market for both products, the
        health-conscious consumer, it appears that My Organic
        Baby might be the perfect extension of the Clearly
        Canadian brand, literally introducing consumers to the
        company in their infancy.

        Recent comments from James Dines of The Dines Letter
        affirm this belief, stating, “The course has been set
        (for Clearly Canadian) and the company fully
        understands and embraces the exponential benefits
        available through the continuous branding of Clearly
        Canadian as a recognizable and trusted name in the
        organic and natural sector.”

        Since inception, Clearly Canadian has been highly
        regarded as a consistent beverage innovator with
        products/brands such as Orbitz (the first beverage with
        floating beads), Battery (one of the first energy
        drinks) and Reebok fitness water (one of the first
        vitamin enhanced waters).

        Clearly Canadian is well known as a leading producer of
        premium alternative beverages that all begin with one
        simple ingredient: pure, refreshing water.  Its
        legendary line-up of naturally flavoured sparkling
        waters has sold over two billion bottles to date.  Its
        newly-introduced line-up of premium, non-carbonated
        Natural Enhanced Waters are well positioned to make a
        lasting impression on the increasingly health-conscious
        beverage industry.  In a strong indication that
        healthier premium beverages are supplanting soft
        drinks, Coca Cola (NYSE: KO) recently agreed to pay
        Glaceau, the maker of Vitaminwater, $4.2 billion in
        cash and stock.

         The NEW Clearly Canadian:  A Family of Healthy Choices

        Clearly Canadian’s recent acquisitions mark the
        company’s debut to entirely new and exciting food and
        beverage categories.  This new direction began with the
        February 2007 acquisition of leading organic and snack
        food company Sweet Selections- opening up some
        complimentary snacking options to go with Clearly
        Canadian’s premium line-up of beverages.  In May 2007,
        the company acquired My Organic Baby Inc. – Canada’s
        first full nationwide line of organic baby food.  This
        innovative and fast growing line has over 30 product
        offerings listed in leading baby food retailers across
        the country and expanding to the US.

        Clearly Canadian is well into a major transformation
        into a diversified, branded company focusing on the way
        of the future:  healthy, natural and organic products.
        Clearly Canadian now owns a group of premium brands in
        the beverage, snack and baby food categories that make
        up its family of healthy choices.

        with future line extensions to include smaller packs
        aimed at the single serve snack category.

        David Reingold, President of DMR Food's, stated, "We
        are delighted by the acceptance of this new program
        from an organization such as Loblaws. A leader in the
        health food category with stores from coast to coast,
        Loblaws is the largest food distributor in Canada. We
        are confident these large pack sizes will attract
        traditional bulk dried fruit and nut customers as a
        much more convenient packaging alternative." Reingold
        continued, "I am convinced about the potential that the
        Glengrove product line has in today's marketplace. Our
        launch in Loblaws further validates our formula of
        starting with a quality product and adding great
        packaging, reliable delivery and excellent service."

           Clearly Canadian Acquires Eastern Canada's Leading
                         Organic Snack Company

          Management Sees Diversity and Synergy Resulting from
                          Strategic Acquisition

        VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Clearly
        Canadian Beverage Corporation (OTCBB:CCBEF - News),
        (the "Company"), is pleased to announce it has acquired
        DMR Food Corporation. Operating under the name Sweet
        Selections, DMR is the leading seller of organic and
        natural snack foods in Eastern Canada.

        "With the recent introduction of our Clearly Canadian
        Natural Enhanced Waters, including dailyEnergy,
        dailyVitamin and dailyHydration, a certified organic
        essence water, this acquisition accelerates our efforts
        to further establish Clearly Canadian as a provider of
        healthy, good-for-you, products," said Brent Lokash,
        President of Clearly Canadian. "We see great upside in
        Sweet Selection's business over the next several years
        as retailers are placing a major emphasis on organic
        and natural products. With a growth rate of over 25%
        per year and a strong presence in Canada's largest
        grocery chains, Sweet Selections is an ideal complement
        to Clearly Canadian's brand recognition and established
        presence in the beverage sector. This combination
        creates a host of opportunities to penetrate our key
        markets and fulfills our stated objective to enter into
        the complementary snack food market."

        Mr. Lokash added, "Our model for growth into the
        organic and natural foods market is to emulate what
        Pepsi/Frito Lay has done so well over the years in
        connecting beverages and snack food. We believe the
        combination of these two companies will provide a host
        of strategic opportunities to penetrate this exploding
        market and create value for our shareholders. Sweet
        Selections is a fast growing and profitable company.
        This acquisition will nearly double top line revenues
        with little immediate dilution to our shareholders."

        In connection with the acquisition of Sweet Selections,
        the Company has paid $450,000 CDN upon closing of the
        transaction; 3,000,000 warrants to purchase the
        Company's common shares at a purchase price of US $4.00
        per share, provided that if a gain of $2,550,000 CDN is
        not realized from a sale of the warrants within 1 year
        from their sale of the warrant shares, the Company will
        pay any shortfall; and $450,000 CDN payable over 3
        years. In addition, the Company has entered into a 3
        year consulting agreement to retain the services of
        Sweet Selection's founder, David Reingold.

<p>Dear StockUpTicks Reader:
<p>A recent acquisition by a leading beverage company of an organic baby
food producer would seem at first glance an odd pairing.&nbsp; This may
well have been the perspective of some investors when <b>Clearly Canadian
(OTCBB:CCBEF)</b> announced that the company completed its acquisition
of <b><font color="#006600">My Organic Baby</font></b>, which has national
distribution in Canada for its organic baby food products.
<p>But when you consider the market for both products, the health-conscious
consumer, it appears that <b><font color="#006600">My Organic Baby</font></b>
might be the perfect extension of the Clearly Canadian brand, literally
introducing consumers to the company in their infancy.
<p>Recent comments from <b>James Dines of <i>The Dines Letter</i></b> affirm
this belief, stating, “The course has been set (<i>for Clearly Canadian</i>)
and the company fully understands and embraces the exponential benefits
available through the continuous branding of Clearly Canadian as a recognizable
and trusted name in the organic and natural sector.”

Since inception, <b>Clearly Canadian</b> has been highly regarded as a
consistent beverage innovator with products/brands such as Orbitz (the
first beverage with floating beads), Battery (one of the first energy drinks)
and Reebok fitness water (one of the first vitamin enhanced waters).&nbsp;
<p>Clearly Canadian is well known as a leading producer of premium alternative
beverages that all begin with one simple ingredient: pure, refreshing water.&nbsp;
Its legendary line-up of naturally flavoured sparkling waters has sold
over two billion bottles to date.&nbsp; Its newly-introduced line-up of
premium, non-carbonated Natural Enhanced Waters are well positioned to
make a lasting impression on the increasingly health-conscious beverage
industry.&nbsp; <u>In a strong indication that healthier premium beverages
are supplanting soft drinks, Coca Cola (NYSE: KO) recently agreed to pay
Glaceau, the maker of Vitaminwater, $4.2 billion in cash and stock.</u>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+2>The <i><u>NEW</u></i> Clearly
Canadian:&nbsp; A Family of Healthy Choices</font></font></b></center>

<p>Clearly Canadian’s recent acquisitions mark the company’s debut to entirely
new and exciting food and beverage categories.&nbsp; This new direction
began with the February 2007 acquisition of leading organic and snack food
company Sweet Selections- opening up some complimentary snacking options
to go with Clearly Canadian’s premium line-up of beverages.&nbsp; In May
2007, the company acquired <b>My Organic Baby Inc.</b> – Canada’s first
full nationwide line of organic baby food.&nbsp; This innovative and fast
growing line has over 30 product offerings listed in leading baby food
retailers across the country and expanding to the US.
<p>Clearly Canadian is well into a major transformation into a diversified,
branded company focusing on the way of the future:&nbsp; healthy, natural
and organic products.&nbsp; Clearly Canadian now owns a group of premium
brands in the beverage, snack and baby food categories that make up its

a strong presence in Canada's largest grocery chains, Sweet Selections

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Mr. Lokash added, "Our
