Dear valued member.
This is a letter from United Medical Research Organization. We just wanted to ask you to be as attentive as possible when buying drugs on the Web.
So far, the experts of our Association has been dissatisfied with the quality of almost all the Web pharmacies that we have been investigating. Actually, the only pharmacy we can recommend you is USDrugs – the only e-shop we’re constantly monitoring thus reducing the danger of drug falsification to the minimum.
Take care of your health – use generic drugs from licensed manufacturers and providers only!
