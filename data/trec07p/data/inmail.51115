Melody just told me about what they have been doing lately.

Your not going to believe it at first because neither did I.

They get to stay home everyday, use the phone returning phone calls and actually
making a really good living from it.

They don't have to sell anything at all, just simply returning calls on the companies behalf.

Last week thier earnings were in excess of 5k!!

So you know I figured what the heck lets give it a try so I called the 24hr info line and got all the details.

So I was thinking about you and figured you may want to find out more yourself so here is the number.

1.8OO.679.O1O8


I really hope you give them a call as I would hate to see you miss out. This is perfect for stay at home moms,
retirees or anyone else who has always wanted to be there own boss.


Anyways have a great day, call them up and let me know how it went.

Again the number is 1.8OO.679.O1O8


Talk Soon








Since we had communicated in the past I thought of you as likely a person who would be interested.
If I am mistaken then let me know with a reply via email so I don't bother you anymore.

Thanks
