I enter the house. Mia is busy washing clothes. I grab her from her shoulders and make her stand right in front of me so close that we feel our breaths hitting our faces, our hearts listen to each other's beats, or eyes play with together, and I, taking her hands into mine, thrust our fingers together.

Our intention is to offer to only those interested. If not the mechanizim is in place for you to decide.
