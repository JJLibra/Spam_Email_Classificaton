Today   the   Sydney  Car      Centre       is    looking    for       an       industrious       regional       assistant   to     fasten   the     process  of  the   delivery  of    customer payments    to     the    suppliers.    The position     offered       is      a    part-time   job,      and       will      only       require   from   you     to     be       available     for       1-2      hours  a    day.<br><br>

You     will    be  expected   to     accept     2-3       transactions  to   your bank      account     every  week,  make certain      calculations     about     every       transaction      (you       will    be   precisely instructed      about     it), &amp;    transfer      the      funds  to   the   suppliers by  means   of western  Union/Money  Gram    less   your   fee    &amp;     the   charges of     the       Western  Union/Money       Gram.  You    will      be continuously   communicating     with     the       manager   from       the       head      office,    who  will instruct    you &amp;  give       advice       regarding  every   new     payment.<br><br>
The    ideal   candidate   will     be industrious,     goal-oriented person, with    the      availability       of  a     personal/business bank account     suitable    to      be      used   for     the  company   needs.   Knowledge     of       English,      computer      literacy      and  sociability are appreciated.<br><br>
