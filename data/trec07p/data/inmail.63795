LANDSCAPE 

Getting into universities, particularly the best ones, is no easy task overseas, either. In some nations, students take multiple-day tests. In India, more than 100,000 college students compete in rounds of tests and interviews for a few hundred spots at the Indian Institute of Science, a graduate school. The acceptance rate is 0.3 percent.  

Talinda didn't make much of it. She was married to a rock star, so she knew how obnoxious fans could be. They blasted Linkin Park songs outside the couple's house at 3 am. Nailed lyrics to their front door. One time, a woman slammed on her brakes and caused an accident when she saw Chester strolling by — she had to stop and tell him how much she loved him. "There are always going to be encounters that you kind of wish went differently," Chester says. "But the average fan really isn't fanatical."

The AMA recently suggested that perhaps gaming addiction should be considered as a sub-category of internet addiction. This is a step in the right direction. Clearly "internet addiction" doesn't begin to cover the realm of bizarre and pathological behaviors the internet inspires. Herewith a list of afflictions and syndromes I feel should be added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, or perhaps the DSM IV.Ib. 

They are very cool, but a bitch to install, especially if your floors and doors aren't perfectly level. So be prepared to tweak, tweak, tweak.

Subject: about the japanese fuel cells 
It's really a sad reflection of the Internet age when this "online encyclopedia" has detailed entries on every episode and charater of some bizzare TV drama, and yet articles about real people are being deleted for being "not notable" according to the esteemed wacky editors. 

My wife is a professional percussionist. After three years of hearing her play marimba, djembe and conga in our living room -- and hearing me fumble around on our upright piano -- our neighbors wanted assurances that we would keep things quiet in our new home.
