Mike Benny & Co Chambers
Mike Walk Off Hampton Street,
London Se1 6tl,
United Kingdom,
+44-701-113-3602
Dear  Freind,

      This is a personal email directed to you and I request that it
should be treated as such. I am Mike Benny, a solicitor at law.
I am the personal attorney/sole executor to the late Mr. Robert,
hereinafter referred to as 'my client' who worked as a independent oil
merchant in my country and who died in a car crash with his immediate
family on the 5th of Nov 2000. Since the death of my client in Nov, 2000,
I have written several letters to the embassy with intent to locate any of
his extended relatives whom shall be claimants/beneficiaries of his
abandoned personal estate and all such efforts have been to no avail. More
so, I have received official letters in the last few weeks suggesting a
likely proceeding for confiscation of his abandoned personal assets in
line with existing laws by the bank in which my client deposited the sum
of £9.8Million GBP .

 The board of directors of the company now adopted a resolution and I was
mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money within
the next 15 official working days or forfeit the money as an abandoned
fund. The company had planned to invoke the abandoned property Decree of
1996 to confiscate the funds after the expiration of the period given to
me but after an investigation in the finance company, I found out that
some members of the company wants to divert this fund into their private
accounts for their own selfish interest and only want, to use the excuse
that since I am not able to look for some one to make the claim, the
money should be made unserviceable and that means submitting the f
company management which is not their main intentions.


  By virtue of my closeness to the deceased and his immediate family, I am
very much aware of my client's financial standing. I do sincerely
sympathize the death of my client, but had thought it unprofitable for
his funds to be submitted to the federal government of this country and
the finance company where it is lodged. I have reasoned very
professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as
the next of kin of my deceased client which is legally possible and
would be done in accordance with the laws of the land.

 On this note I decided to search for a credible person and finding that
you bear a similar last name, I was urged to contact you, that I may,
with your consent, present you to the "Trustee" bank as my late client's
surviving family member so as to enable you put up a claim to the bank in
that capacity as a next of kin of my client, so that the proceeds of This
Bank Account valued at Nine  Million Eight Hundred Thousand British
Pounds Sterling only (£9.8Million)  can be paid to you, before they get
confiscated or declared unserviceable to the bank where this huge deposit
is lodged. Note that this is legal and 100% risk free since I have all
vital documents that would be requested by them and that would confer you
the legal right to make this claim. I find this possible for the main
reason that you bear a similar last name with my client making it a lot
easier for you to put up a claim in that capacity. Therefore, to
facilitate the immediate reprofiling of this fund, you need, first to
contact me via my alternative email address signifying your interest and
as soon as I obtain your confidence, I will immediately intimate you with
the complete details as well as fax you the documents, with which you are
to proceed and I shall direct on how to put up an application to the
bank.


However, you will have to assent to an express agreement which I will
forward to you in order to bind us in this transaction. Upon the receipt
of your reply, I will send you by Fax or E-mail the next step to take. I
will not fail to bring to your notice that this proposal is hitch-free and
that you should not entertain any fears as the required arrangements have
been made for the completion of this transfer. I guarantee that this will
be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of the law. Please get in touch with me through my alternative
email esq_benny@yahoo.co.uk  for better confidentiality and send to me
your telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about this
transaction.
      Like I said, I require only a solemn confidentiality on this. Please
let me have your opinion as soon as possible for my contact number
is +44-704-572-0108,and if this proposal is acceptable by you, do
not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you, I
await your urgent response.
Give me a call at your earliest convenience.

Please get in touch with me through my alternative email
