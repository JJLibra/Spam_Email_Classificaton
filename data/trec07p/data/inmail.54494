&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get it fast&quot; &#150; &quot;do it now&quot;=
 &#150; even &quot;lose five pounds overnight!&quot;&nbsp; If you pay any at=
tention to advertisements or the media, it seems like we're being bombarded =
with messages to speed things up, get things quickly, and find instant grati=
fication.&nbsp; So I'm not really surprised that stress seems to be playing =
such a major part in our lives.&nbsp; We seem to be living in an environment=
 that urges hurry and emphasizes instant solutions.&nbsp; Do you find that t=
o be true, too, Memo?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why I was so tickled to come across an &qu=
ot;instant solution&quot; that actually does work &#150; and it helps to rel=
ieve stress!&nbsp; And it involves the most basic life activity &#150; breat=
hing.&nbsp; This little exercise can be done inconspicuously anywhere, anyti=
me.&nbsp; So, the next time you find yourself feeling anxious or tense or un=
able to concentrate, why not try it?&nbsp; It will help you feel calmer and =
more grounded.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Here's what you do.&nbsp; Sit comfortably and start to pay attention to y=
our breathing.&nbsp; Notice how shallow or deep it is, but don't try to chan=
ge the rhythm of it.
<P>Now, curl your fingers over your thumbs to make a fist with each hand.&nb=
sp; Then, squeeze your thumbs firmly and hold it for a minute or so.
<P>When you do this, you'll notice that your breathing will very quickly bec=
ome deeper and stronger.&nbsp; As you continue the squeeze, along with the d=
eeper breathing, you will also start to feel stronger and more centered, bot=
h mentally and physically.
<P>Then release your thumbs, and your breathing will return to &quot;normal.=
&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Memo, for some real &quot;instant gratificati=
on,&quot; now you know what to do!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a New Moon this week, Memo, on the14h and in Ge=
mini.&nbsp; This is usually a seeding time for new ideas or projects and, wi=
th Mars still in feisty Aries making positive links to steady Saturn on the =
11th and imaginative Neptune on Wednesday, it's worth jotting your ideas dow=
n and putting them somewhere safe.&nbsp; But when Mercury turns retrograde o=

<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your duties and responsibilities take on a lighter w=
eight.  Not only will they seem easier and more fun, you may receive some re=
cognition from those who are looking on.





<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are already feeling some tension around your =
work arena, then you will need to cultivate an attitude of flexibility today=
.  Stick to disciplined routine, dear one.  Ignore the unwise counsel of ano=

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, you are open to new ideas, but today, a f=
