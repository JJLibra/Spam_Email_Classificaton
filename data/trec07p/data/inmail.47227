 Edgar Allan Poe   January 19, 1809  ndash  October 7, 1849  was an American
poet, short story writer, playwright, editor, critic, essayist and one of the
leaders of the American Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of the
macabre and mystery, Poe was one of the early American practitioners of the
short story and a progenitor of detective fiction and crime fiction. He is also
credited with contributing to the emergent science fiction
genre. ref Stableford, Brian.  Science fiction before the genre.  The Cambridge
Companion to Science Fiction, edited by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn.
Cambridge  Cambridge University of Press, 2003. pp 18 19. /ref  Poe died at the
age of 40. The cause of his death is undetermined and has been attributed to
alcohol, drugs, cholera, rabies, suicide  although likely to be mistaken with
his suicide attempt in the previous year , tuberculosis, heart disease, brain
congestion and other agents. ref Meyers, Jeffrey. Edgar Allan Poe  His Life and
Legacy. Cooper Square Press, 1992. p. 256 /ref

family in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 19, 1809, the son of actress
Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe and actor David Poe, Jr. He had a Mayflower

misspelled as  Allen   even in encyclopedias , it is actually  Allan,  which he
had chosen as a sign of respect towards this family, though he was never
formally adopted.

The Allan family baptised young Edgar as Episcopalian in 1812 and John Allan
alternatively spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son. ref Meyers,
Jeffrey. Edgar Allan Poe  His Life and Legacy. Cooper Square Press, 1992. p.
9 /ref  The family, which included Allan s wife Frances Valentine Allan,
traveled to England in 1815, and Edgar sailed with them. He attended the Grammar
School in Irvine, Scotland  where John Allan was born  for a short period in
1815, before rejoining the family in London in 1816. He studied at a boarding
school in Chelsea until the summer of 1817. He was then entered at Reverend John
Bransby   s Manor House School at Stoke Newington, then a suburb four miles
north of London. ref Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe  Mournful and Never ending
Remembrance. Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 16 8 /ref  Bransby is mentioned by name
as a character in  William Wilson. 

Poe moved back with the Allans to Richmond, Virginia in 1820. In 1825, John
Allan s friend and business benefactor William Galt, said to be the wealthiest
man in Richmond, died and left Allan several acres of real estate. The
inheritance was estimated at three quarters of a million dollars. By the summer
of 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two story brick
home named  Moldavia.  ref Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe  Mournful and Never

The /Red/tailed Hawk/

 /Buteo jamaicensis/ is a large bird of prey. It breeds
almost throughout North America fr

om western Alaska and northern Canada to as
far South as Panama and the West Indies.

This

 is one of three species colloquially known in the United States as the
/chickenhawk./

De

scription

Males can weigh from 690 to 1300 grams /1.5 to 2.9 pounds/ and measure 45///56


cm /18 to 22 in/. Females can weigh between 900 and 2000 grams /2 and 4.4
pounds/ and meas

ure 50///65 cm /20 to 26 in/ in length. The wingspan is from 110
to 145 cm /43 to 57 in/. 

This blocky bird is relatively heavy for its length.
Birds of this species can usually be 

distinguished from other [[Buteo]]s by a
dark mark along the leading edge of the underwing

, between the body and the
wrist /the patagium/. Most, but not all color variations have a

 dark brown band
across the belly. The light adult/s breast is pale while the light juveni

le/s
breast is a whitish color. Light morphs have a white V ranging from its back to
its w

ings. In most, the adults/ tails are rusty red above, and juveniles have
narrow brown and 

pale bands. The main western North American population has
bands on the adults/ rusty tail

s as well and has varied plumage, organized into
three main color types or morphs.

Immatu

re birds, or birds that are only a few years old, can also readily be
identified by having

 yellowish irises. As the bird attains full maturity over
the course of 3///4 years, the i

ris slowly darkens into a reddish/brown hue.

/ Light/morph birds are mainly brown on the 

upperparts and very pale brown or
  buff on the underparts and underwings/ they show a bel

ly band.
/ Rufous/morph birds are darker and redder, with reddish/brown rather than white


  on the underparts. The belly band may be barely visible.
/ Dark/morph birds are very dar

k brown on both upperparts and underparts/ they
  have lighter parts on the underwings.

A

lmost all of the main eastern North American population are light/morph, with
whiter under

parts and paler markings than western birds, and with solid rust/red
tails as adults.

Oth

er variations are/
/ /Harlan/s Hawk/ usually has blackish plumage contrasting with white u

ndersides
  of the flight feathers/ the tail may be reddish or grey and is longitudinally


  streaked rather than barred. This is the only type of Red/tail in which the
  dark wing 

marking is not distinct. It breeds in Alaska and northwestern Canada
  and winters from Ne

braska and Iowa to Texas and northern Louisiana. It is
  sometimes considered a separate s

pecies, Buteo harlani, or subspecies, B.
  jamaicensis harlani.
/ /Krider/s Hawk/ is paler

 than other red/tails, especially on the head/ the
  tail may be pinkish or white. It is m

ainly found in the central prairies of
  the United States.

Resident breeding birds in Ce

ntral America have cinnamon underparts which
enables them to be easily distinguished from 

the paler/breasted wintering
migrants /Stiles / Skutch/.

Habitat and reproduction

The br

eeding habitat is open country with high perches, and any area within this
definition may 

be utilized. They build a stick nest in a large tree, in a
cactus, or on a cliff ledge 35 

m /115 ft/ or higher above ground/ they may also
nest on man/made structures. A lot of the

 time these hawks build their nests
near clear, open feeding areas which will eliminate th

e need to search for prey.

The shells of these birds/ eggs are colored a dull or bluish/w

hite with a
granulated or smooth surface, never glossy. There may be some splotches of
var

ious shades of brown. The eggs are usually about 60 x 47 mm /2.4 x 1.9 in/.
Incubation is 

by the female is 28 to 35 days, during which time she is fed by
her mate. The female then 

broods the chicks until the youngest is about 30 to 35
days. The young are able to fly at 

about 45 days of age, but are often dependant
on the parents for a further 7 to 8 weeks.



Behavior


Red/tailed Hawks generally prefer to wait on a certain perch and swoop down on


prey/ though they will also patrol open areas in flight. They mainly eat small
mammals, bi

rds and reptiles. Their favorite prey varies with regional and
seasonal availability but u

sually includes cottontails, rodents, pheasants and
quail. Other prey includes waterfowl, 

bats, shrews, snakes, lizards,
crustaceans, insects, and, when near the water/s edge, carp

 and catfish. Those
that live in cities may prefer Rock Pigeons and European Starlings, bo

th of
which are plentiful in many urban areas. Prey taken can range in size from
beetles t

o a White/tailed Jackrabbits, which are double the weight of most Red/
tails. The Great Ho

rned Owl occupies a similar ecological niche nocturnally,
taking most of the same prey. Co

mpetition may occur between Red/tails and Great
Horned Owls during twilight hours, but att
