When they turned into the driveway to reverse direction, Annie rushed out and screamed at them to get off her land before she shot them for the dirty dogs they were. If you ever get out of this, youll work yourself around in much the same fashion to thinking you never needed your left foot anyway - hell, five less nails to clip.

Sincerely,
Colleen Stanford
