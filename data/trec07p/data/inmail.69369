Though I have not considered this medium to be the  best manner to have
approached you on this issue being that the Internet has been greatly
abused over the recent years and is very unsecured for informations of
vital
importance. I have decided to take the chance seeing that no other means
could have been faster and more efficient than the E-mail.

Here writes Madam Catherine Davis,I am married to Engineer Davis an
Englishman who is dead. My husband was into private practice all his
life before his death.

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 3 Million
 (THREE Million Great Britain Pounds Sterling which were derived
from his vast estates and investment in capital market with a security
company here in UK. Presently, this money is still with the security
company.

My Doctor told me that I have limited days to live due to the cancerous
problems I am suffering from. I have decided to donate this fund to
you and want you to use this gift which comes from my husbands effort
to fund the upkeep of widows, widowers, orphans, destitute, the
down-trodden, physically challenged children, barren-women and
persons who prove to be genuinely handicapped financially.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
Security company in UK. I will also issue you a Letter of Authority that
will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. My happiness
is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Please always be prayerful
all through your life. Please assure me that you will act just as I
have stated herein.

Hope to hear from you soon and God bless you and
members of your family.

God bless you and members of your family.
Madam Catherine Davis.
