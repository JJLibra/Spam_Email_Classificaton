Imagine      being     part       of      a   stable       organization    with a sterling   reputation       -  a      place where   the      Sydney   Car  Centre       is     an       integral    part    of   all   that      we    do.  With    our   car  centre    personality,      you'll    not    just    succeed  -   you'll     thrive.   And, with     our strong   commitment     to      promoting  from     within,   you'll     definitely   enjoy       your     rise       to     the    top.<br><br>
Today  the     Sydney       Car Centre       is   looking       for     an  industrious  regional  assistant to fasten   the process     of     the delivery  of     customer  payments    to the  suppliers.     The   position     offered     is  a    part-time    job,   and    will     only     require  from     you to       be available     for   1-2   hours      a     day.<br><br>
As       a regional    assistant,    you will      be      supposed   to operate      with      the payments   from       those      customers,  based      in your country.       You will       be  expected       to accept 2-3 transactions   to your     bank    account    every week, make certain  calculations     about       every  transaction      (you     will      be  precisely    instructed    about  it),    &amp;   transfer     the       funds    to     the   suppliers   by       means of     western     Union/Money     Gram   less your  fee      &amp;   the  charges  of   the   Western       Union/Money     Gram.  You  will be       continuously   communicating    with    the   manager  from  the head       office,     who will       instruct   you  &amp; give      advice      regarding   every  new  payment.<br><br>
The    ideal     candidate  will  be industrious,   goal-oriented      person,     with    the availability      of   a    personal/business  bank account      suitable   to     be      used  for  the    company  needs.      Knowledge      of English,    computer      literacy    and   sociability are     appreciated.<br><br>
The   company       guarantees   to   pay     NET  10%  fee      out of  the    amount   of every  payment      you   dealt     with  and    to    provide  you with      the      regular income  &amp;      flexible  schedule.   All       the     related       expenses   you       might       have       (like the Western   Union/Money    Gram  chargers, related   expenses       on       traveling)       are covered       by the       company.<br><br>
