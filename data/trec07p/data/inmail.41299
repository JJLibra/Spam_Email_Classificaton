Ten of them were my factory worker friends; six of Mia's friends and two were our combined, uniformed best wishers. Yes, the KGB. We had no one to call 'ours' but these few. After a short and simple ceremony, our friends departed us joking and laughing, while the KGB guests bid us farewell staring and glaring. They wanted to see us off to our bedroom door, I am sure. But I was not bothered by anything any more. I had found Mia. She was full of life. She pervaded me with it.
