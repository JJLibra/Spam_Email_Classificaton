BusinessNetWire's Issues "Investor Focus" On SREA

Score One Inc. (SREA)

Market Watchers continue to alert investors as SREA rockets higher. Get
on SREA now!

Spike will probably be in high school but Erica will continue not to
age. Susan Lucci is so busy promoting her lines on QVC, etc, that she
shows up in between.
Herzlich willkommen bei blogigo. The show was boring at best. The new
Greenlee is not a good actress- she needs to leave town again and poor
Kendall and Zach deserve some happiness along with lots of other Pine
Valley Residents! I hate to hear that Babe and Jamie will be leaving for
California.

And not just beat them, but dominate them.

Come on writers give us something to watch.
Pinging is currently not allowed. And by the way, I think Annie and
Greenlee are portrayed by beautiful women.

The new Greenlee is horrendous, the teens are still taking over.
Someone needs to save this show. She screwed up her life, and thinks
that Pine Valley owes her a debt of gratitude for returning. Court Backs
School On Speech Curbs - washingtonpost. I just keep hoping I will tune
in and see something I care to watch.
Lets see more of Josh and whatever happened to the island of pregnant
woman   Lets send Greenlee there and maybe shell make someone else
miserable instead of the fans.

And you can put all the blame on the San Antonio Spurs.
And not just beat them, but dominate them. I have always liked Erica but
I wish she would get a makeover, she needs to cut her hair and wear
clothes to hide that wrinkly neck. Brian Frons needs to go!

I hate to hear that Babe and Jamie will be leaving for California. The
writing is just awfull, with boring story lines.
