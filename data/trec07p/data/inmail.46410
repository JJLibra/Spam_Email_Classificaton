 Cuba , officially the  Republic of Cuba  Spanish    Audio CUBA.ogg Cuba    or

consists of the island of Cuba  the largest of the Greater Antilles , the Isle
of Youth and several adjacent small islands. Cuba is located in the northern
Caribbean at the confluence of the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the
Atlantic Ocean. Cuba is south of the eastern United States and the Bahamas, west
of the Turks and Caicos Islands and Haiti and east of Mexico. The Cayman Islands
and Jamaica are to the south.

Cuba is the most populous country in the Caribbean. Its culture and customs draw
from several sources including the aboriginal Ta  no and Ciboney peoples, the
period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of African slaves, and its
proximity to the United States. The island has a tropical climate that is
moderated by the surrounding waters  however, the warm temperatures of the
Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba itself almost completely blocks access to
the Gulf of Mexico, make Cuba prone to frequent hurricanes.

History


The recorded history of Cuba began on 28 October 1492, when Christopher Columbus
sighted the island during his first voyage of discovery and claimed it for
Spain. ref Gott, Richard   Cuba A New History. Yale University Press. p13  /ref 
 This is still not certain and is an unresolved topic. ref name book2  /ref  The
island had been inhabited by Amerindian peoples known as the Ta  no and Ciboney
whose ancestors had come from South America several centuries before. The Ta  no
were farmers and the Ciboney  also written Siboney neo Taino nations  were both
farmers and hunter gatherers  some have suggested that copper trade was
significant and mainland artifacts
[http //museum.archanth.cam.ac.uk/IACA.WWW/amulet.htm] have been found in
proximal Taino cultures.

The coast of Cuba was fully mapped by Sebasti  n de Ocampo in 1511, and in that
year the first Spanish settlement was founded by Diego Vel  zquez de Cu  llar at
Baracoa. Other towns, including Havana  founded in 1515 , soon followed. The
Spanish, as they did throughout the Americas, oppressed and enslaved the
approximately 100,000 indigenous people that resisted conversion to Christianity
on the island. Within a century they had all but disappeared as a distinct
nation as a result of the combined effects of European introduced disease,
forced labor and genocide, though aspects of the region s aboriginal heritage
has survived in part via the rise of a significant Mestizo population. ref name  Taino  [http //www.hartford

/Elizabeth Barrett Browning/ /March 

6, 1806 /ndash/ June 29, 1861/ was a member
of the Barrett family and one of the most resp

ected poets of the Victorian era.

Biography Elizabeth spent her youth at Hope End in 1809

, near Great Malvern.
While still a child she had a considerate fortune from the Jamaican 

Sugar
Plantations due to her father /Edward Moulton/ who published 50 copies of a
juvenile

 epic, on the Battle of Marathon. She was educated at home, but owed her
profound knowledg

e of the Greek language and much mental stimulus to her early
friendship with the blind sc

holar, Hugh Stuart Boyd, who was a neighbor.

In her early teens, Elizabeth contracted a l

ung complaint, possibly
tuberculosis, although the exact nature has been the subject of mu

ch
speculation, and was treated as a permanent invalid by her parents. For a girl
of that 

time, she was well/educated, having been allowed to attend lessons with
her brother/s tuto

r. She published her first poem, anonymously, at the age of
fourteen, but wrote her first 

at the age of twelve. In 1826 she published
anonymously An Essay on Mind and Other Poems.



Shortly afterwards, the abolition of slavery, a cause which she supported /see
her work T

he Runaway Slave at Pilgrim/s Point /1849//, considerably reduced Mr.
Barrett/s means. He 

accordingly disposed of his estate and moved with his family
first to Sidmouth and afterwa

rds to London. At the former location Miss Barrett
wrote Prometheus Bound /1833/. After he

r move to London she fell into delicate
health, her lungs being threatened. This did not, 

however, interfere with her
literary labours, and she contributed to various periodicals /

The Romaunt of
Margaret/, /The Romaunt of the Page/, /The Poet/s Vow/, and other pieces. I

n
1838 appeared The Seraphim and Other Poems /including /Cowper/s Grave//.

Shortly therea

fter, the death of her favorite brother gave a serious shock to
her already fragile health

/ and for a time she hovered between life and death.
Eventually, however, she regained str

ength, and meanwhile her fame was growing.
The publishing about 1841 of /The Cry of the Ch

ildren/ gave it a great impulse,
and about the same time she contributed some critical pap

ers in prose to Richard
Henry Horne/s New Spirit of the Age. In 1844 she published two vol

umes of Poems,
which comprised /The Drama of Exile/, /Vision of Poets/, and /Lady Geraldin

e/s
Courtship/.

In 1845 she met for the first time her future husband, Robert Browning. T

heir
courtship and marriage, owing to her delicate health and the extraordinary
objections

 entertained by Mr. Barrett to the marriage of any of his children,
were carried out under

 somewhat peculiar and romantic circumstances. After a
private marriage at St Marylebone P

arish Church and a secret departure from her
home, she accompanied her husband to the Ital

ian Peninsula, which became her
home almost continuously until her death, and with the pol

itical aspirations of
which she and her husband both thoroughly identified themselves.

Th

e union proved one of unalloyed happiness to both, though it was never
forgiven by Mr. Bar

rett. In her new circumstances her strength greatly
increased, and she gave birth to a son

, Robert Wiedemann Barrett Browning,
called /Pen,/ at the age of 43. The Brownings settled

 in Florence, and there she
wrote Casa Guidi Windows /1851////by many considered her stron

gest work///under
the inspiration of the Tuscan struggle for liberty. In Florence she beca

me close
friend of British/born poets Isabella Blagden and Theodosia Trollope Garrow.

[[A

urora Leigh]], her largest, and perhaps the most popular of her longer poems,
appeared in 

1856. In 1850 The Sonnets from the Portuguese///the history of her
own love/story, thinly 

disguised by its title /Robert Browning called Elizabeth
Barrett /[his] Portuguese/ as a p

et name because of her complexion.////had
appeared. In 1860 she issued a collected edition

 of her poems under the title,
Poems before Congress which were political poems. Soon ther

eafter her health
underwent a change for the worse/ she gradually lost strength, and died 

on June
29, 1861. She is buried in Florence in the English Cemetery, Florence.

Mrs. Brown

ing was a woman of singular nobility and charm, and though not
beautiful, was remarkably a

ttractive. Mary Russell Mitford thus describes her as
a young woman/ /A slight, delicate f

igure, with a shower of dark curls falling
on each side of a most expressive face/ large, 

tender eyes, richly fringed by
dark eyelashes, and a smile like a sunbeam./ Anne Thackeray

 Ritchie described
her as/ /Very small and brown/ with big, exotic eyes and an overgenerou

s mouth.

Literary significance Browning is generally considered the greatest of English
p

oetesses. Her works are full of tender and delicate, but also of strong and
deep, thought.

 Her own sufferings, combined with her moral and intellectual
strength, made her the champ

ion of the suffering and oppressed wherever she
found them. Her gift was essentially lyric

al, though much of her work was not so
in form. Her weak points are the lack of compressio

n, an occasional somewhat
obtrusive mannerism, and frequent failure both in metre and rhym

e.

Her most famous work is [[Sonnets from the Portuguese]], a collection of love
sonnets

period of Spanish colonia<ism, the introduction of Afric/>can s<aves, and its
proximity to the /> Un<ited State/>s. The <s/>sland has a trop<ical clim/>mate that is

History

/>
The recorded history of Cuba began <n /> 28 October 1492, when Chr<istopher Columbus/>s
sighted the island during his first v<oyage of discovery a/>nd claimed it for
Spain. ref Gott, Rich<ard   Cuba A New History. />Yale Uni<ersity Press. p13  /ref 
 T/>This is still not certain and is<an unresolved topic. /> ref name book2  <ref  The
isla/>nd had been inhabit<ed by Amerindian p/>eoples known as the Ta  n<o and Ciboney
whose />ancestors had come from Sout< America several centuries before. The/>e Ta  no
were farmers <n/>nd<the Ciboney  also writ/>ten Siboney neo Taino <nations  were both
farmers and hunter/> gatherers  some hav< suggested t/>hat copper< trade was
significant and mainl/>land artifacts

<proximal Taino cu/>ltures.

The coast of<Cuba was fully mapped by Sebasti  n/>n de Ocampo in 1511, and<in that
year the first Spanish se/>ttlement was fou<nded by Diego Vel  zquez de Cu  llar a/>t
Baracoa. Other towns, including Havana< foun/>nded in 151<5 , soo/>n followed. The
Spanish, <as they did throughout the/> Americas, oppressed a<d enslaved the
