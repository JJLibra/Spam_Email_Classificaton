    The Matrix  is a science fiction action film written and directed by Larry
and Andy Wachowski and starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne
Moss, Joe Pantoliano and Hugo Weaving. It was first released in the USA on March
31, 1999, and is the first entry in   The Matrix   series of films, comics,
video games and animation.

The film describes a future in which the world is actually the Matrix, a
simulated reality created by sentient machines in order to pacify, subdue and
make use of the human population as an energy source by growing them and
connecting them to the Matrix with cybernetic implants. It contains numerous
references to the cyberpunk and hacker subcultures  philosophical and religious
ideas, including Vedanta, messianism, Baudrillard s idea of hyperreality and
Socratic, Cartesian, and Platonic idealism  and homages to [[Alice s Adventures
in Wonderland]], Hong Kong action movies and Japanese animation.

Plot Computer programmer Thomas A. Anderson leads a secret life as a hacker
under the alias  Neo . He wishes to learn the answer to the question   What is
the Matrix?  Cryptic messages appearing on his computer monitor and an encounter
with several sinister agents lead him to a group led by the mysterious Morpheus,
a man who offers him the chance to learn the truth about the Matrix.

Neo accepts. Swallowing a red pill, he abruptly wakes up naked in a liquid 
filled chamber, his body connected by wires to a vast mechanical tower covered
with identical pods. The connections are severed and he is rescued by Morpheus
and taken aboard his hovercraft, the [[List of ships in the Matrix
series Nebuchadnezzar/Nebuchadnezzar]]. Neo s neglected physical body is
restored, and Morpheus explains the situation. The year is around 2199  Morpheus
states that  we honestly don t know  what year it really is , and humanity is
fighting a war against intelligent machines created in the early 21st century.
The sky is covered in thick clouds created by the humans in an attempt to cut
off the machines  supply of solar power. The machines responded by using human
beings as their energy source, growing countless people in pods and harvesting
their bioelectrical energy and body heat. The world which Neo has inhabited
since birth is the Matrix, an illusory simulated reality construct of the world
of 1999, developed by the machines to keep the human population docile. Morpheus
and his crew are a group of free humans who  unplug  others from the Matrix and
recruit them to their resistance against the machines. Within the Matrix they
are able to use their understanding of its nature to bend the laws of physics
