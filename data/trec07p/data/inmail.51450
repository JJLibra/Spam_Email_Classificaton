Dear WSEAS "Computer Science and Computing" Community

We received several emails from a great number of authors 
from China and other Asian Countries complaining that they could not
open the WSEAS Web Pages.  They claim that from May 1 until June 3,
they could not have access to the WSEAS Web Pages.  After this
feedback, we return to our former provider and we give prolongation
for the conferences AIC, ISCGAV and ISTASC until
June 30, 2007

See these emails at:

ADDITIONAL FEATURES FOR THE WSEAS CONFERENCES OF AUGUST 2007
www.wseas.org


1) Publication of the Proceedings in 3 media: hard-copy, CD, E-Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(A) Hard-Copy Proceedings (Book) with ISBN and ISSN indexed by the
major Citation Indexes: www.worldses.org/indexes

(B) CD-ROM Proceedings with pages' numbers with ISBN and ISSN 
    indexed  by the major Citation Indexes: www.worldses.org/indexes

(C) E-Library:  http://www.wseas.org/online

and possible:

  (D) JOURNAL PUBLICATION: Authors of high - quality papers of
archival value are invited to send extended versions of their papers
to the international WSEAS Journals after the conference. Necessary
Condition is the presentation of the paper in the congress
See the procedure on the web site of the WSEAS:
 http://www.wseas.us/reports/


2) A very strong and important feature is that the WSEAS is going to
give you a new username and password WITHOUT EXPIRY DATE for on-line
access in the WSEAS Conference proceedings FOR EVER.

       
3) We have already arranged and each of you will receive in the CD-ROM
Proceedings, not only the Proceedings of these WSEAS conferences of
2007 , but also the Proceedings of the same conferences in 2006 in
Greece. Except the CD-ROM proceedings you will also receive Books
(Hard-Copy) Proceedings with all the papers of the Multiconference 


4) Because we will maintain the same policy in 2008, your paper will
be available and readable in the CD-ROM that we will distribute in
Germany in August of 2008 where we will have the same conferences.
 

5) After the presentation of your paper we are going to consider it
for possible publication in the WSEAS Journals that, as you know,
participate in all the International Scientific Indices (Elsevier,
Scopus, EI, Compendex, INSPEC, CSA .... see: www.worldses.org/indexes 
  )

6) Important Plenary Speakers. See the web pages of the Conferences

7) Rich cultural and social part as usual in WSEAS events.
The importance of these conferences can be proved by the impact
of these conferences in 2006: See, please
http://www.wseas.us/reports/ 



8) The conference Books (Hard-Copy Proceedings), CD-ROM proceedings
and (Journals with selected papers) published by WSEAS Press continue
to sell for a long time after the meeting has taken place. This is
another demonstration of the prestige the scientific community
attribute to the meetings organised by the WSEAS.


9) WSEAS has arranged collaboration with Hindawi Publishing Corp
http://www.hindawi.com and Springer Verlag,
so, several papers will appear in Volumes of Hindawi Publishing
and Springer Verlag. The authors can select between WSEAS Journals,
Springer Verlag Volumes and Hindawi Publishing Company, however, this
requires presentation of your paper in the conference, submission
of extended version after the conference and additional review and
revision. As you can see we have already started a collaboration with
the Springer verlag and enhanced and revised versions of these
presented papers might appear in Springer Verlag volumes after the
Conference.
