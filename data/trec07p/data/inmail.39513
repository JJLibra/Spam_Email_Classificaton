<STYLE> Volleyball  is an Olympic sport in which two teams separated by a high net use
their hands, arms or  rarely  other parts of their bodies to hit a ball back and
forth over the net. ref  /ref  Each team of six players is allowed three hits to
get the ball over the net to the other team. A point is scored if the ball hits
the ground in the opponents  court, if the opponents commit a fault, or if the
opponents fail to return the ball properly.

Because many offensive plays involve contacting the ball above the top of the
net, vertical jumping is an athletic skill emphasized in volleyball. ref  /ref 
History of Volleyball

On February 9, 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts  USA , William G. Morgan, a YMCA
physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette as a pastime
to be played preferably indoors and by any number of players. The game took some
of its characteristics from tennis and handball. Another indoor sport,
basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles
 sixteen kilometers  away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts only four
years before. Mintonette  as volleyball was then known  was designed to be an
indoor sport less rough than basketball for older members of the YMCA, while
still requiring a bit of athletic effort.

The first rules, written down by William G. Morgan, called for a net 6 feet 6
inches  1.98 meters  high, a 25    50 foot  7.6    15.2 meter  court, and any
number of players. A match was composed of 9 innings with 3 serves for each team
in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before
sending the ball to the opponents    court. In case of a serving error, a second
try was allowed. Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul  with loss
of the point or a side out   mdash  except in the case of the first try serve.
To protect the fingers of the ladies, they were allowed to catch the ball and
then throw it back into play.

After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at
its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the Springfield YMCA, the game
quickly became known as volleyball  originally spelled as two words volley
ball . Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the Springfield YMCA and the
game spread around the country to other YMCA locations.

In 1900, a ball was made specifically for the new game. The rules have evolved
over time  by 1916, the skill and power of the set and spike had been
introduced, and four years later a  three hits  rule and back row hitting
guidelines were established. In 1917, the game was changed from 21 to 15 points.
In 1919, American Expeditionary Forces distributed 16,000 volleyballs to their
troops and allies  this provided a stimulus for the growth of volleyball outside
the United States.

The first country outside the United States to adopt volleyball was Canada in
1900. An international federation, the F  d  ration Internationale de Volleyball
 FIVB , was founded in 1947, and the first World Championships were held in 1949
for men and 1952 for women. Volleyball was added to the program of the Olympic
Games in 1964. The sport is now popular in Brazil, in Europe  where especially
Italy, Netherlands and countries from Eastern Europe have been major forces
since the late 1980s , in Russia, and in other countries including China and the
rest of Asia, as well in as the United States.

Beach volleyball, a variation of the game played on sand and with only two
players per team, became a FIVB endorsed variation in 1986 and was added to the
Olympic program at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The FIVB estimates that 1 in 6
people in the world participate in or observe indoor volleyball, beach
volleyball, or backyard  recreational  volleyball.

Volleyball in the Olympics

The history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the 1924 Summer Olympics
in Paris, where volleyball was played as part of an American sports
demonstration event. ref  /ref  After the foundation of FIVB and some
continental confederations, it began to be considered for official inclusion. In
1957, a special tournament was held at the 53rd IOC session in Sofia, Bulgaria
to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was
officially included in the program for the 1964 Summer Olympics.

The Olympic volleyball tournament was originally a simple competition, whose
format paralleled the one still employed in the World Cup  all teams played
against each other team and then were ranked by wins, set average, and point
average. One disadvantage of this round robin system is that medal winners could
be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in
the outcome of the remaining matches. To cope with this situation, the
competition was split into two phases with the addition of a  final round 
elimination tournament consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals
matches in 1972. The number of teams involved in the Olympic tournament has
grown steadily since 1964. Since 1996, both men s and women s events count
twelve participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball
confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the
Olympic Games.

The U.S.S.R. won men s gold in both 1964 and 1968. After taking bronze in 1964
and silver in 1968, Japan finally won the gold</STYLE>

/Haiti/ /Ha//ti in French/ Ayiti in Haitian Creole/ 

Hayti in nineteenth century
English/, officially the /Republic of Haiti/, occupies one/thi

rd of the
Caribbean island of Hispaniola, sharing it with the Dominican Republic. Haiti
al

so includes many smaller islands such as La Gon//ve, La Tortue /Tortuga/, Les
Cayemites, /

/le de Anacaona, and La Grande Caye. The uninhabited island of
Navasse is claimed by both 

Haiti and the United States. /Ayiti/ /Haiti/ was the
indigenous Ta//no name for the island

. Its highest point is Chaine de la Selle,
at 2,680 meters. The total area of Haiti is 27,

750/nbsp/km// /10,714/nbsp/sq mi/
and its capital is Port/au/Prince.

A former French colo

ny, Haiti became the first independent black republic and
the only nation ever to form fro

m a successful slave rebellion. Haiti became the
second non/native country in the Americas

 /after the United States/ to declare
its independence, on January 1, 1804.

Haiti has rec

ently undergone a state of transition following the forced ousting
of President Jean/Bertr

and Aristide on February 29, 2004. The circumstances
surrounding his departure from office

 are disputed, with Aristide stating that
he was kidnapped by US government agents who for

cibly put him onto a plane and
flew him out of the country. He had been re/elected in 2000

 by a strong
majority, with most of his support coming from Haiti/s poor masses, which
com

prise a large majority of the country/s population. Ren// Pr//val was elected
president in

 his place on February 7, 2006, and took office in May of that year.

History


The island

 of Hispaniola, of which Haiti occupies the western third, was
originally inhabited by the

 Ta//no Arawak people. Christopher Columbus landed at
M//le Saint/Nicolas on December 5, 1

492, and claimed the island for Spain.
Nineteen days later on Christmas Eve, 1492, the [[S

anta Mar//a /ship//Santa
Maria]] ran aground near the present site of Pen/island Cap/Haiti

en and Columbus
was forced to leave 39 men, founding the settlement of La Navidad . /Ayiti

/,
which means /mountainous land/, is a name used by its early inhabitants, the Taino/
Ara

wak people, who also called it /Bohio/, meaning /rich villages/, and
/Quisqueya/, meaning 

/high land/.

The Ta//nos were a seafaring branch of the South American Arawaks. Ta//no me

ans
/the good/ or /noble/ in their language. A system of [[Cacique/cacicazgos]]
/chiefdoms

/ existed, called Mudlen, Maguana, Higuey, Magua and Xaragua, which
could be subdivided. T

he cacicazgos were based on a system of tribute,
consisting of the food grown by the Ta//n

o. Among the cultural signs that they
left were cave paintings around the country, which h

ave become touristic and
nationalistic symbols of Haiti. Xaragua is modern day Leogane, a 

city in the
southwest.

One of the earliest leaders to fight off Spanish conquest was Quee

n Anacaona, a
Taino princess from Xaragua who married Chief Caon

<STYLE><< V/>Volleyball  is an Olympic sport in w<ich t/>two teams separated by a high net use<
their/> hands, arms or  rarely<  other parts of thei/>ir bodies to hit a b<ll back a/>nd
forth over the net. ref  /ref< Each /> team< of /> <ix players is allowed t/>three hits to
get th< ball over the net to the other team/>m. A point is scored if the <all hits
the ground/>d in the opponents  court, if t<he opponents commit/> a fault, or if the
opponents fail to <return the ball properly.

Because m/>many offensive plays involve contactin<g the ball above />the top of the
net, vertical jumpin<g is an athletic skill emphasized in v/>olleyball. ref  /ref 
History of Voll<yball

On February /> 9, 1895, i< Holyoke, Massa/>achuse<tts  />USA , William G< Morgan, /> a YMCA
physical education directo<, created a new game cal/>led Mintonette as a pastime
to be played<preferably indo/>oors and by any number of players. T<e game took some
of its character/>ristics <from tennis/> and hand<ba/>all. Another indoor<sport,
b/>basketball,< was catching />on in the area, having bee<n invented just ten miles
/>
 sixteen kilometers  awa< in the city of Springfield/>, Massachusetts only four
years b<fore. Mint/>onette  as volleyball was then known  <as designed/>d to be an
indoor sport less <ough than basketball for older members/>s of the <YMCA, while
still />requiring a bit of ath<etic effort./>.

The first rules, written dow<n by William G. Mor/>rgan, called<for a net 6 feet 6
inches />  1.98 meters  high, a 25    50 foot<  7.6    15.2 meter/>  court, and any
number of players. A ma<tch was composed of 9 innings/>s with 3 serves for ea<ch team
in />each inn<ing, />and no limit to th<e number of ball contacts for ea/>ach team before<sending the ball to the oppon/>nents    court. In case of a servi<ng error, a second
try was a/>llowed. Hitting the <all into the net was considered a foul /> with loss
of the point or a side out<   mdash  /> except in the case<of the first try serve.
To protect/>t the fingers of the ladies, <hey were all/>low<d to catch the ba/>all and
then throw it back into pla<y.

After an observer, Alfr/>red Halstead, noticed t<he /> volleying n<ture o/>of the game at
its first<exhibition match /> in 1896, played at the Springfield YMCA< the game
qui/>ickl<y became known as volleybal/>l  originally spelled as two words volle<
ball/>l<. Voll/>eyball ru<es were slightly modifie/>ed by the Springfield YMCA and the<game spread around the country to oth/>er YMCA locations.

In 1900, a ball< was made specifical/>ly for the new game. The rules have evo<ved
over time  by 1/>916, the skill and power of the set< and spike />had been
introduc<ed, and four years later a  three hi/>its  rule and back row hitting
g<idelines were establis/>shed. In 1917, the game was change<d from 21 /> to 15 points.
In 1919, American< Expeditionary Forces dist/>ributed 1<6,000 vo/>lleyballs to thei<
troops and allies  this provided a sti/>imulus for the gr<ow/>th of voll<eyball outside
the U/>nited Stat<es.

The first country outside />the United States to adopt volleyball w<as Canada in
1900. An international fe/>ederation<, the F  d/>  ration <Internationale de Volleyball
 FI/>IVB , was<founded in 1947, and the f/>fir<t World Championships were held i/>in 1949
fo<r men and 1952 for women. Volleyball w/>as added to the <rogram of /> the Olym<pic
Games in 1964. The sport is now p/>opular in Brazil, in Europe<  where especially
Italy, Net/>therlands and countries from Eastern E<rope have been major forc/>ces
since the late< 1980s , in Russia, and in other/> countries including China and<the
rest of Asia, as well /> in as the United States.

Beach volleyb<ll, a variation of the game played/> on sand and with only two
pla<yer/>r< per team, beca/>me a FIVB<endorsed variation in 1986 and/>d was added to the
Olympic program at <he 1996 Summer Olympics. The FIVB es/>stimates that 1 in 6
people in the wo<rld partici/>pate in or observe indoor volleyb<all, beach
volleyball/>, or backyard  recreat<ional  volleyball.

Volleyball in the Olympic/>c<

The history of Olympic volleyball can/> be tra<ced back to the 1924 Summer /> Olympics
in Paris, w<here volleyball was pl/>ayed as p<art of an American sports
demonstr/>ation event. re<f  /ref  After the foundation of FI/>IVB and some
continental confede<ations, it began to be consider/>ed for official inclusion. In
1957, a <special tournament was held at the 53rd/>d IOC s<ssi/>ion <n Sofia, Bulgaria
to support such re/>quest. The c<ompeti/>tion was a success, and th< sport was
officially included in the p/>rogram for the 19<64 Summer Olym/>pics.

The Olym<pic volleyball tournamen/>t was originally a simple competiti<n, whose
format p/>aralleled the one still emplo<yed in t/>he World Cup  all teams played
agai<nst each other team and then we/>ere ranked by wins, set average, and<point
average. On/>e disadvantage of this round robin syste<m is that medal winners cou/>uld
be determined before the end of the< game/>es, making the a<dience lose interes/>st in
<the outcome o/>f the remaining matches. To cope< wit/>h this si<uation/>n, the
<competition was split in/>to two phases with the< addition of a  final roun/>nd 
elimin<tion tournamen/>t consisting of quarterfinals, sem<ifinals, /> and f<nals
matches in 1/>1972. The number of teams involved <in the/> Olympic tournament has
grown steadily< since 1964. Since 1996, both men s/>s and women s events count
tw<lve participant nations. Each of the fiv/>ve continental volleyball
confeder<tions has at least one affi/>ili<ted na/>ational federation involved in the
Olym<ic Ga/>mes.

Th<e U.S/>.S.R. won men s gold in <bot/>th 1964<and /> 1968. After taking bronz<e in 1964
and silver in 196/>8, Ja<an finally won t/>he gold/></STYLE><p><HR width="90%" SIZE=1><p><center>
