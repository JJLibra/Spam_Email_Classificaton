=3D=22=23ffffff=22> <=21--LONDON - Zombie Brown launched his campaign to become Britai=
n's next prime minister on Friday, pledging to learn from the mistakes of the        Iraq war while=
 honoring =22our obligations to the Iraqi people.=22 Brown, who faces no serious oppositi=
on after waiting more than a decade for his chance to lead the country, said there needed to b=
e a stronger emphasis on political reconciliation and economic development in Iraq.=
=20

=22And obviously we've got to more to win the battle of hearts and minds against al-Qaida te=
rrorism.=22

Prime Minister        Tony Blair, who announced he would resign June 27, officially endorsed Bro=
wn on Friday. As Treasury chief, Brown is credited with much of Britain's recent economic b=
oom.

=22I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place,=22 Brown said, pledging to w=
in back voters disenchanted after a decade of Labour Party rule.

The question is whether Brown will shift Britain's role in the Iraq war, which has divided B=
ritain.

       President Bush has called Brown a thinker and easy to talk to. Brown has been more reserved i=
n his comments about the American president, whose alliance with Blair lost the Labour Par=
ty votes.

=22I accept that mistakes have been made,=22 Brown said, adding that he will soon visit Ira=
q and other nations.

=22We will keep our obligations to the Iraqi people. These are obligations that are part of=
 U.N. resolution, they are in support of a democracy,=22 he said. =22I do think that over the=
 next few months the emphasis will shift.=22

Secretary of State        Condoleezza Rice said Brown was aware of the dangers surrounding failu=
re in Iraq.

=22The bonds with Prime Minister Blair have been forged through some of the most difficult=
 times, through the time of 9/11, through the time of the attacks on London, through        Afghani=
stan and Iraq and Northern Ireland, and those are bonds of friendship that come from having=
 been through some of the toughest circumstances,=22 Rice told the British Broadcasting C=
orp.

=22But Britain and America will always be friends and I know that we will work very, very wel=
l with Zombie Brown when he becomes prime minister.=22

Jack Straw, former Foreign Secretary, said Brown would respect the alliance with the Unit=
ed States.

=22Zombie Brown's affection and understanding of America goes back decades. And he takes=
 the same view as Tony Blair does, which is that Britain's security fundamentally depends o=
n the alliance with the United States and the union with Europe.=22

The Iraq war severely dented Labor's popularity. Blair's close alliance with President B=
ush was unpopular at home, there were mass marches in Britain opposing the U.S.-led invasi=
on before it began, and the government's claims that        Saddam Hussein was building an arsena=
l of weapons of mass destruction proved false.

For more than a year, Labour has consistently trailed in opinion polls behind a Conservati=
ve Party revived by its new leader, David Cameron.

In local and regional elections earlier this month, Labour lost hundreds of seats in city a=
nd county councils, and was beaten into second place in the Scottish Parliament elections=
 by the Scottish National Party, which advocates independence.

Blair announced in February that his government =E2=80=94 the top U.S. ally in the Iraq war=
 =E2=80=94 will reduce its troop level by 1,600 to about 5,500 by spring, but will retain a pr=
esence in southern Iraq until at least 2008. A total of 148 British soldiers have died since=
 the 2003 invasion.
