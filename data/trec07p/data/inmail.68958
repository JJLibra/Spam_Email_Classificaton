I was hesitant about using Cialis. Had a prescription for 6 months before I filled it and a couple of weeks before I used it. Since then it has changed my wife's and my lives. 25mg begins to work in about 15 minutes to a half an hour and lasts for 3 hours or so, Able to have an erection and intercourse more than once in a few hours. Her climaxes are more intense than ever and whenever mine come they come, so to speak. Wish I could use it a few times a day. Lots of water when taking the pill helps alleviate stuffiness and slight headache. Wow!<br>
