Dear valued member.
This is a letter from United Medical Research Organization. We just wanted to ask you to be as attentive as possible when buying drugs on the Web.
This letter is NOT a piece of ad – we just want you to know that more 80% of the drugs you purchase on the Internet come from underground factories in southern Asia – so, apparently, no one can say that they are totally safe. The only drugstore that has managed to prove the quality of its meds so far is USDrugs.
Remember! Taking generic drugs you will secure yourself against poisoning!
