Imagine       being  part  of       a    stable       organization   with    a  sterling  reputation -  a  place    where    the  Sydney      Car       Centre     is    an integral    part    of    all     that   we do.

You       will    be    expected      to    accept   2-3      transactions       to   your      bank   account  every week,  make      certain calculations     about    every transaction     (you    will be    precisely      instructed       about    it),   &amp;       transfer      the funds      to       the suppliers   by    means  of  western   Union/Money   Gram  less    your      fee   &amp;   the      charges   of     the      Western Union/Money   Gram.     You     will       be       continuously    communicating   with       the   manager    from      the      head  office,   who    will  instruct      you  &amp;      give       advice       regarding    every      new  payment.<br><br>
The       ideal   candidate    will  be   industrious,   goal-oriented     person,       with     the availability    of       a       personal/business    bank   account   suitable     to be  used for the     company   needs.       Knowledge       of     English,    computer literacy   and      sociability      are       appreciated.<br><br>
