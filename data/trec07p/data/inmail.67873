<p><font face="sans-serif">While     we may  have   high      expectations   of  our  associates,   we    also    give  them     high   rewards.  Imagine       being       part    of     a      stable   organization      with       a     sterling   reputation -  a place  where the Sydney      Car     Centre      is  an integral       part    of    all   that we     do.       With      our car centre     personality,    you'll    not   just    succeed      -       you'll thrive.       And,    with  our strong  commitment to     promoting  from    within,       you'll   definitely       enjoy   your   rise to       the top.<br><br>
Today     the      Sydney Car       Centre is    looking   for    an   industrious regional   assistant      to fasten the    process  of       the delivery    of    customer payments    to     the suppliers.      The    position    offered  is       a       part-time      job,  and      will  only       require      from    you  to be     available  for    1-2    hours      a       day.<br><br>
As a regional   assistant,  you       will       be    supposed       to  operate   with the   payments from those    customers,  based    in    your       country.   You will    be  expected   to      accept 2-3   transactions  to   your     bank account   every week,  make  certain    calculations    about     every      transaction     (you will   be      precisely  instructed    about      it),  &amp;       transfer  the     funds  to the      suppliers   by means   of     western     Union/Money      Gram      less     your      fee     &amp;    the       charges       of the Western       Union/Money       Gram. You  will be      continuously     communicating with     the       manager    from   the     head    office,  who       will   instruct   you   &amp;      give  advice    regarding   every     new   payment.<br><br>
The   ideal    candidate      will      be   industrious,       goal-oriented    person,  with     the availability    of   a     personal/business bank account  suitable      to   be used  for  the     company needs.  Knowledge   of   English,       computer       literacy   and   sociability are       appreciated.<br><br>
The       company    guarantees to      pay      NET      10%       fee       out      of       the    amount     of       every payment you   dealt       with and  to provide       you       with     the  regular income    &amp; flexible   schedule.     All      the     related   expenses   you       might  have   (like  the       Western       Union/Money   Gram       chargers,     related    expenses     on  traveling) are  covered    by     the company.<br><br>
