The  question mark   also known as an  interrogation point ,  query , ref In
journalism. See Truss, Lynne. Eats, Shoots   Leaves, 2003. p. 139. ISBN 1 592 40087 
6. /ref  or  eroteme   is a punctuation mark that replaces the full stop at the
end of an interrogative sentence. It can also be used mid sentence to mark a
merely interrogative phrase, where it functions similarly to a comma, such as in
the single sentence  Where shall we go? and what shall we do? , but this usage
is increasingly rare. The question mark is not used for indirect questions. The
question mark character is also often used in place of missing or unknown data.


History

The symbol is generally thought to originate from the Latin qu  stio, meaning
 question , which was abbreviated to Qo. The uppercase Q was written above the
lowercase o, and this mark was transformed into the modern symbol.

Another hypothesis about the origin of the question mark proposes that it
originated in the 9th century, when it appeared as a point followed by the
curved portion written slanted  similar to the tilde, although the tilde was
tilted more upward to the right, plus, question mark means question mark. .
Lynne Truss attributes an early form to Alcuin of York. ref Truss, Lynne. Eats,
Shoots   Leaves, 2003. p. 76. ISBN 1 592 40087 6. /ref  Truss describes the
punctus interrogativus of the late 700s as  a lightning flash, striking from
right to left.  The name  question mark  was coined in the late
1800s. ref Truss, Lynne. Eats, Shoots   Leaves, 2003. p. 76. ISBN 1 592 40087 
6. /ref 

The point has always indicated the end of a sentence. The curved line
represented the intonation pattern of a spoken question, and may be associated
with a kind of early musical notation, like neumes.

Spacing before question mark Some writers place a space between the end of their
sentence and the question mark. This usage is thought to stem from French
practice and is known as French spacing. In French a space is always placed
before question marks and exclamation marks, as well as colons and semicolons
 see at French Wikipedia . In English, however, the insertion of this space is
generally considered bad form. The Oxford English Dictionary rules against it.
Some English language books do appear to have these spaces, but these are often
a thin space or a hair space, which are not full spaces but merely a form of
kerning used to make the text less cramped and thus easier to read.  For
detailed discussion of spaces after a question mark, see Full stop. 

Other languages

In some languages, such as Spanish and Galician, typography since the 18th
century has required opening and closing question marks, as in    Qu   hora es? 
 What time is it?   an interrogative sentence or phrase begins with an  inverted
question mark         and ends with the question mark   ?    see more on usage
in Spanish . However, this orthographical convention is often disregarded in
quick typing.

In Greek and Church Slavonic, a semicolon     is used as a question mark.

In Armenian the question mark       has a form of an open circle and is placed
over the last vowel of the question word.

In Arabic, which is written from right to left, the question mark      is
mirrored right to left from the English question mark.  Some browsers may
display the character in the previous sentence as a forward question mark due to
font or text directionality issues.  Hebrew is also written right to left, but
uses a question mark that</STYLE>

Campus The main campus building at Valhallav//gen 

in //stermalm, by architect
Erik Lallerstedt, was completed in 1917. The buildings and sur

roundings were
decorated by prominent early 20th century Swedish artists such as Carl Mill

Axel T//rneman, Georg Pauli, Tore Strindberg and Ivar Johnsson. The older
buildings on

 the campus went through a complete renovation in 1994. While the
original campus was larg

was expanded with new buildings. T

distributed across several campuses in Stockholm C
