[[Conepatus]] br  [[Mydaus]] br  [[Mephitis  genus /Mephitis]] br 
[[Spilogale]] br      Skunks  are mammals, usually with black and white fur,
belonging to the family Mephitidae and to the order Carnivora. There are 11
species of skunks, which are divided into four genera  [[Mephitis
 genus /Mephitis]]  hooded and striped skunks, two species , [[Spilogale]]
 spotted skunks, two species , [[Mydaus]]  stink badgers, two species , and
[[Conepatus]]  hog nosed skunks, five species . The two skunk species in the
Mydaus genus inhabit Indonesia and the Philippines  all other skunks inhabit the
Americas from Canada to central South America.

Skunks were formerly considered to be a subfamily of the Mustelidae family of
weasels and related animals  where some taxonomists still place them , but
recent genetic evidence shows that they are not as closely related to the
Mustelidae as formerly thought. ref Dragoo, J., R. Honeycutt. 1997. Systematics
of mustelid like carnivores. Journal of Mammalogy, 78 2  426 443.  ref 

Skunks are sometimes called [[Mustelidae/polecat]]s because of their visual
similarity to the European polecat  Mustela putorius , a member of the
Mustelidae family.

Description

Skunk species vary in size from about 15.6 in.  40 cm  to 27 in.  70 cm  and in
weight from about 1.1 lb.  0.5 kg   the spotted skunks  to 10 lb.  4.5 kg   the
hog nosed skunks  They have a moderately elongated body with reasonably short,
well muscled legs, and long front claws for digging.

Although the most common fur color is black and white, some skunks are brown or
gray, and a few are cream colored. All skunks are striped, even from birth. They
may have a single thick stripe across back and tail, two thinner stripes, or a
series of white spots and broken stripes  in the case of the spotted skunk .
Some also have stripes on their legs.

Anal scent glands The best known, most distinctive, and often most notorious
feature of the skunks is the great development of their anal scent glands, which
they can use as a defensive weapon. It is similar to, though much more developed
than, the glands found in species of the Mustelidae family. Skunks have two
glands, on either side of the anus, that produce a mixture of sulfur containing
chemicals  methyl and butyl thiols  that has a highly offensive smell that most
people describe as a combination of the odors of rotten eggs, garlic and burnt
rubber. The odor of the fluid is strong enough to ward off bears and other
potential attackers, and can be difficult to remove from clothing. Muscles
located next to the scent glands allow them to spray with high accuracy as far
as 2 to 3 metres  7 to 10 ft . The smell aside, the spray can cause irritation
and even temporary blindness, and is sufficiently powerful to be detected by
even an insensitive human nose anywhere up to a mile downwind. Their chemical
defense, though unusual, is effective, as illustrated by this extract from
Charles Darwin s [[The Voyage of the Beagle]] 

 blockquote We saw also a couple of Zorillos, or skunks,  odious animals, which
are far from uncommon. In general appearance the Zorillo resembles a polecat,
but it is rather larger, and much thicker in proportion. Conscious of its power,
it roams by day about the open plain, and fears neither dog nor man. If a dog is
urged to the attack, its courage is instantly checked by a few drops of the
fetid oil, which brings on violent sickness and running of the elbow. Whatever
is once polluted by it, is for ever useless. Azara says the smell can be
perceived at a league distant  more than once, when entering the harbour of
Monte Video, the wind being off shore, we have perceived the odour on board the
 Beagle.  Certain it is, that every animal most willingly makes room for the
Zorillo. ref   ref   blockquote 

Skunks are reluctant to use their smelly weapon, as they carry just enough of
the chemical for five or six uses   about 15 cc   and require some ten days to
produce another supply. Their bold black and white colouring however serves to
make the skunk s appearance memorable. Where practical, it is to a skunk s
advantage to simply warn a threatening creature off without expending scent  the
black and white warning colour aside, threatened skunks will go through an
elaborate routine of hisses and foot stamping and tail high threat postures
before resorting to the spray. Interestingly, skunks will not spray other skunks
 with the exception of males in the mating season   though they fight over den
space in autumn, they do so with tooth and claw.

The singular musk spraying ability of the skunk has not escaped the attention of
biologists  the names of the family and the most common genus  Mephitidae,
Mephitis  mean  stench , and Spilogale putorius means  stinking spotted weasel .
The word skunk is a corruption of an Abenaki name for them, segongw or segonku,
which means  one who squirts  in the Algonquian dialect.

Most predatory animals of the Americas, such as wolves, foxes and badgers,
seldom attack skunks   presumably out of fear of being sprayed. The exception is
the great horned owl, the animal s only serious predator, which, like most
birds, has a poor to nonexistent sense of smell.
