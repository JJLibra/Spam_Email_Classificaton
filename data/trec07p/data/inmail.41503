Good day,

I am Barrister Richard Edward Varden personal Attorney to Ronald Lake 
and Joyce Lake who used to work with Frank Howard Allen Realtors. On 
the 31st of January 2000, my client and his wife were involved in a Plane 
Crash (Alaska Airlines Flight 261) all passengers unfortunately lost 
their lives, since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of 
my client?s extended relatives but this proved unsuccessful.

You can read more about there death on this website below:
http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/

After all these several unsuccessful attempts, since it's not 
compulsory that the next-of-kin must be a blood relation to the 
deceased, hence I contacted you because you are from the same 
country with my late client, Be informed that a next-of-kin can 
be anybody, friends or organization.

Presently,the Bank where the deceased (my client) had a Deposit valued 
at US$74,980,000.00 Million issued me a notice to provide the 
next-of-kin to my client to receive its benefit or have the account 
confiscated, so I have contacted you to assist me in repatriating this
benefit left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the Bank.

To this effect, I now seek your consent to present you to the Bank as 
the next of kin of the deceased (my Client) so that the proceeds of 
this Deposit valued at US$74,980,000.00 Million can be paid to you and then 
you and I can share the money; 70% to me and 25% to you, while 5% will 
be used in settling any incurred expenses on both sides.

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement 
that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch 
with me via my private Email: varden_richard_edward@yahoo.co.uk with 
the below details immediately you acknowledge the good receipt of this 
message.
