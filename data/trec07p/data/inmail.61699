<p><font     face="sans-serif">While  we  may      have       high      expectations    of our    associates,   we  also   give them   high  rewards.       Imagine  being       part of       a  stable    organization  with   a   sterling reputation   - a    place where       the    Sydney     Car  Centre       is       an   integral   part      of   all   that we  do.   With       our      car     centre personality,    you'll  not     just succeed -     you'll     thrive.     And,      with      our    strong  commitment       to  promoting      from       within,     you'll  definitely enjoy       your   rise      to       the top.<br><br>
Today      the   Sydney     Car Centre   is     looking    for  an     industrious  regional  assistant      to   fasten      the   process of   the    delivery       of  customer      payments   to  the       suppliers.  The  position    offered      is a     part-time  job, and    will     only       require       from you   to    be     available   for 1-2    hours    a  day.<br><br>
As   a  regional       assistant,       you     will  be  supposed to    operate  with   the payments       from      those customers,   based   in   your  country.      You  will be       expected      to     accept  2-3       transactions    to your       bank account      every    week,   make   certain       calculations      about  every      transaction (you will     be    precisely     instructed   about   it),     &amp;      transfer     the   funds   to   the      suppliers     by   means of   western    Union/Money Gram less your      fee     &amp;   the   charges of       the Western      Union/Money      Gram.   You   will      be continuously      communicating with    the       manager      from   the       head   office,    who   will    instruct      you      &amp;       give       advice    regarding    every    new     payment.<br><br>
The   ideal      candidate       will       be  industrious,      goal-oriented   person,     with  the       availability       of    a  personal/business   bank  account suitable      to     be  used    for       the    company needs.       Knowledge       of   English,       computer  literacy   and   sociability       are   appreciated.<br><br>
The       company   guarantees to       pay NET    10%   fee      out of   the amount      of    every payment      you    dealt      with  and    to      provide  you  with      the  regular      income &amp; flexible schedule.    All     the   related      expenses     you     might       have (like  the     Western   Union/Money      Gram  chargers,  related   expenses    on  traveling)     are      covered      by     the  company.<br><br>
