Subject: Sabol's film, subtitled The NFL's Longest Day, proved enough of a hit with the league that they bought Sabol's company and re-named it NFL Films.

Crystal clear dialogue is also integrated into these tracks well. The
revue charmingly repurposes songs from the Sondheim book to tell a
narrative about a cocktail party and a series of relationships and
situations that arise therein.
With crisp, well-balanced harmonies and potent but not overpowering
orchestrations, the songs sound especially vibrant, and even the
passionate wailing of both Hudson and Knowles resists distortion.
Most of a viewer's time is spent waiting for something to happen,
boredom punctuated with bursts of action.
Thrown in as generous bonuses are episodes of the Lost Treasures series
that NFL Films produced. It's an entertaining re-cap of the season,
which saw the Steelers win their first title, over the Vikings. Catching
it on the Cartoon Network from time to time myself, I gather that it is
an engaging series for preteens.
Since then, NFL Films has become an vital part of the NFL, becoming what
I would imagine is the most successful industrial film house of them
all. I've had a love-hate relationship with Reggie Miller through the
years. It's a great premise for a movie, and generally it's taken
advantage of; but some of the necessary story elements do feel a little
shopworn. The genuine affection between them makes it easy relate to
even this slightly lecherous husband.
Condon's articulate comments inform and enlighten, but everyone involved
contributes fascinating tidbits.

The print appears to be surprisingly clean, with only minimal specking
and dirt, although grain is a constant. He's actually kind of goofily
moving as he moons over Sacagawea, another of the museum's nocturnal
inhabitants. It's functional and not much more.
By parodying the likes of educational films, children's shows or
commercials, the margin for error is pretty wide open, and in fairness
some of the humor or concepts do work. Curtis' attention, however,
changes her mind, and the two soon begin a rocky romance that's later
complicated by his growing attraction to Deena.

We don't learn much about them personally; the focus is on their onfield
demeanor, which often means insulting and threatening their players,
whether it be overt or vague in manner. And when you're selling a
message to someone like me who is already a convert, and that message is
a challenge to sit through, there's a larger fundamental problem.
The hardest part was teaching 'em to applaud.

The Building the Dream documentary and the featurettes are obviously
shot on digital video and they are breathtakingly gorgeous. Most of a
viewer's time is spent waiting for something to happen, boredom
punctuated with bursts of action. He performs two of his first big hits,
Amarillo by Morning and A Fire I Can't Put Out, both from his second
album.
On the other side, a beefy lifeguard gets to take on three nubile girls
in nighttime pool pile-on, and here there's an abundance of lazy
soft-core grinding and bare flesh. George Strait only appeared once on
the program, when he was still a fresh new artist rather than a
mega-selling star with a multitude of hit singles. Footage of
pre-recording sessions, screen tests, dance rehearsals, and run-throughs
makes us feel like we're really on the set, and bring this musical
blockbuster down to earth.
The cameras don't show us anything cynical or nasty, and the rah-rah
attitude he inspires comes off as utterly alien in this age of media
whores like Terrell Owens and the like. There is some moderate hiss, but
voice quality is generally clear, albeit largely unremarkable in any
way.

You're gonna love me indeed. NFL Films gave football drama and mythology
to go with the inherent violence, and America's new pastime took flight.
George: That's right, Victoria. And when you're selling a message to
someone like me who is already a convert, and that message is a

Like a heavyweight prizefighter unloading a barrage of body blows,
Hudson pummels us with her pain, and it's impossible not to be moved by
her intensity and instrument. The dialogue comes across nicely and there
are decent directional effects across the front mains. Condon, however,
puts his heart and soul into the project, and crafts a buoyantly
entertaining, often exhilarating picture that maintains the energy and
panache of the Broadway original. Audiences possess far more
sophistication than many arrogant filmmakers believe, and Condon's
confidence in our ability to fully embrace the musical genre deserves
commendation. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to it, this new
two-disc release of the second season is a great way to get acquainted.
I know that my daughter has been a fan of the show for quite some time,
but for eight years?
The power of manipulative filmmaking, indeed.
Posterization was quite limited however and on the whole the disc is
very attractive. While Edd is fixing it, Eddy tells Ed that he thinks
Double-D is an alien since he's so smart.
The focus is more on Allen than anything else, as the coach brings in
his preferred veteran players and tries to re-build a floundering
franchise.
It remains worthwhile fodder for debate among football fans, who can now
add in nearly three decades' worth more players to the arguments.
Not essential, but worth a look. It's kind of a nudge-nudge-wink-wink
sort of ploy, and considering there were thirteen of these films made
over a decade says there was no doubt an audience. Lucky for us, the
Dreamgirls transfer aces every element. The one example of compression
ringing I noted was a sequence when Lorrell is seen in closeup in front
of a vivid magenta backdrop; serious ringing was visible at that point.
Again, though, the plot is really just an excuse to throw together some
Sondheim classics.
He's outgrown his Perfect Strangers days, and his introduction to the
show here sets the easygoing and ever-so-slightly naughty tone of the
show perfectly.
This was filmed from a live performance, presumably limiting the audio
presentation options somewhat, but nonetheless the track is full and
rich in a way that showcases the music quite well.
