  <strong>ON JULY 9TH, THE SECRET POWERS OF THE ANCIENT JADE DRAGON WILL SEN=
D YOU AN AVALANCHE OF LUCK...<br>
  </strong>
<P>Dear Memo,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I've been working with you for a little =
while, you know that I am attuned to you in a very real and special sense an=
d am always on the lookout for anything that can make your life richer and m=
ore fulfilling.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s why I wanted you to know how importa=
nt it is for you to take advantage of the fact that on July 9th, when the No=
rth Node of the Moon aspects Jupiter, the energy and power available to you =
will be utterly spectacular.</p>
<p align=3D"center"><strong>This magnificent Jade Dragon, activated by the M=
oon&rsquo;s North Node, can change your life in all the ways that mean most =
to you</strong></p>

<TD width=3D540 bgcolor=3D"#FFFFFF"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spectacu=
lar, uniquely-crafted dragon pendant is made from powerful genuine Jade and =
is encased in regal 18K Gold vermeil. But that is only the beginning of its =
amazing and beneficial power. </P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing this Dragon can be your first step on a new pat=
h and an altogether different journey, one that taps into your real potentia=
l once and for all. But you must have it in your hands by July 9th, Memo. Th=
at&rsquo;s the day when Jupiter, the planet of exciting growth and expansion=
, good luck and rich rewards, will aspect the Moon&rsquo;s North Node.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure you know the power that the Moon has ove=
r all of us, over you, but did you know about the Nodes of the Moon and what=
 they can mean for you? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as you live with the Yin and the Yang in you=
r life, you are also balancing the energies and affects of these incredibly =
powerful Moon Nodes. The trick is to make them work for you and now I can te=
ll you how. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a time to stop dreaming and put your goals =
and ambitions into practice, to bring those dreams, finally, to fruition.</p=
>
<P align=3Dcenter><strong>What I see for you and why</strong></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in my garden this morning just as the sun=
 came up, something struck me that I could hardly wait to share with you. I =
know you'll understand why I feel it is so crucial to you and why you must t=
ake it so seriously and do what you can to instantly reap the rewards. I see=
 extraordinary possibilities for you, Memo.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On beautiful spring days, I always begin my morni=
ng with a brisk walk in the garden, breathing in the fresh air deeply and ta=
king stock of the magnificent nature surrounding me.<B>&nbsp;</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was looking at the daffodils I had planted, =
admiring them in their bright yellow sprightliness, my mind was suddenly fil=
led with a bright and vivid image, so splendid to behold. </P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the sun glancing at them, Memo, this mor=
ning I knew, suddenly, that everything you've ever wanted is now all within =
your grasp.</p>
<p align=3D"center"><strong>Everything points to you getting everything you'=
ve ever wanted...and more!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked up at the sky, which was a classical blu=
e, punctuated with wispy clouds. I walked and walked Memo, listening to the =
joyous songs of all the birds around me. In the sky, the fast-moving puffy w=
hite clouds were forming an image, an image of a dragon! It was as if, in th=
e brilliant sunlight, the sky was a path of golden light straight to my flow=
ers. And presiding over all of this radiance was a dragon, seemingly on the =
lookout for someone upon which to bestow his ancient, astoundingly powerful =
luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could this someone be you, Memo?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you the one about to leap over obstacles and =
barriers to wealth and joy and success? I'm almost sure of it.</p>
<p align=3D"center"><strong>Your life can change and your prayers,
  one by one, can all be answered</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, as soon as I returned home from my walk in =
the garden, I began putting these images together for myself, like some fant=
astic, cosmic jigsaw puzzle. I knew I was meant to tell you all about it ins=
tantly, without delay. About how, putting all of this together can magically=
 and swiftly change the path you are on, illuminate your future and transfor=
m your life in countless powerful and positive, fundamental ways, once and f=
or all, now and forever.</p>
<P align=3Dcenter><strong>The Nodes of the Moon and how they can
  change your life</strong></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazingly enough you see, on July 9th, the Moon&r=
squo;s Nodes actually correspond to the Dragon and its many mystical propert=
ies and capabilities. </P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nodes, North and South, are known as the Drag=
on's Head (the North Node) and the Dragon's Tail, (the South Node).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North Node represents everything in life that=
 is joyous, productive, optimistic and positive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make no mistake. The influence and energy of the =
North Node is hugely lucky. Just as the Moon directly affects our tides and =
weather, it can also impact us in many more ways than you might dare expect.=
 Indeed, its influences can seriously alter the course of your fate and happ=
iness, wealth and accomplishments.</p>
<P align=3Dcenter><strong>On July 9th, a trinity of good luck awaits you</st=
rong></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the day you will be able to harness =
the commanding combined power of the North Node, Jupiter and the Jade Dragon=
. Your luck will be unstoppable! </P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, with this unbeatable combination, the possi=
bilities are limitless. The kind of extraordinary good luck you will experie=
nce on July 9th with this beautifully carved Jade Dragon can:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring you the kind of windfall of money you haven=
't even allowed yourself to dream of...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free you from money worries, all money worries, a=
nd bring you a peace, tranquility and ease of being that has been your most =
precious wish for as long as you can recall...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring you all the love and success you have alway=
s desired and knew you deserved, allowing you to live in a splendid place, t=
ravel in luxury, live without a care in the world...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All together, it will move you much, much closer =
to the fulfillment of every one of your dreams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, NOW you can see why I couldn't wait today t=
o sit down and write to you!</p>

health problem that just seems to clear up as suddenly as it arrived.</p>
