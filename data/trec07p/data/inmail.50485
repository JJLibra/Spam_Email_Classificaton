Hello Dear

I got your contact during my search on the Internet for are liableperson to 
entrust this transaction.My name is lawrence Donkoh.I am the assistant manager 
of the Eco Bank Ghana Ltd.I am writing to solicit your assistance in the 
transfer of US $15,000,000.

This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I am the assistant manager 
made as profit during the last year. I have already submitted an approved End 
of the Year report for the year 2003 to my Head Office here in Accra and they 
will never know of this Excess. I have since then,  placed this amount of US$ 
15,000,000 on a SUSPENCEACCOUNT without a  beneficiary. As an officer of the 
bank, I cannot be directly connected to  this money thus I am impelled to 
request for your assistance to receive  this money into your bank account.

I intend to part 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me. I do  need 
to stress that there are practically no risk involved in this. It's going to 
be a bank-to-bank transfer. All I need from you is to stand as  the original 
depositor of this fund. If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your 
timely response.

With regards,
Dr.Lawrence Donkoh.
