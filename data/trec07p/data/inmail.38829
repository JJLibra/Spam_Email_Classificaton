Dear valued member.
United American Health Association warns you about the risks you run while purchasing your meds on the Internet. Please, read this letter to the end.
Be careful when choosing where to buy your meds from – try to cling to pharmacies that have already made a good name for themselves, such as USDrugs. Always make sure that your online drugstore is a licensed one.
Hope that you take our advice seriously. Take care.
