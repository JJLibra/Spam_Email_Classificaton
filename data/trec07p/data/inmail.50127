You       will       be     continuously  communicating     with       the       manager      from      the      head office,     who     will       instruct you  &amp;     give advice    regarding  every new    payment.<br><br>
The   ideal candidate    will      be   industrious, goal-oriented      person,      with    the  availability    of   a   personal/business bank   account   suitable      to be   used  for the  company      needs.
