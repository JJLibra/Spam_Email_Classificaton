History Fairhope was founded in November, 1894 as a utopian single tax colony by
the  Fairhope Industrial Association   a group of 28 followers of economist
Henry George who had incorporated earlier that year in Des Moines, Iowa. Their
corporate constitution explained their purpose in founding a new colony 

  to establish and conduct a model community or colony, free from all forms of
 private monopoly, and to secure to its members therein equality of opportunity,
 the full reward of individual efforts, and the benefits of co operation in
 matters of general concern. 

In forming their demonstration project, they pooled their funds to purchase land
at  Stapleton s pasture  on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay and then divided it
into a number of long term leaseholds. The corporation paid all governmental
taxes from rents paid by the lessees, thus simulating a single tax. The purpose
of the singe tax colony was to eliminate disincentives for productive use of
land and thereby retain the value of land for the community, offering  a fair
hope of success  and a clear vision. ref See link  Heritage quote  fair hope 
 below . /ref 

 Fairhope Avenue  was one of the properties on the 1910 version of the board
game  The Landlord s Game . Today this game is known as  Monopoly .

In 1907 educator Mudletta Johnson founded the School for Organic Education in
Fairhope. The school was praised in John Dewey s influential 1915 book Schools
of Tomorrow. Dewey and Johnson were founding members of the Progressive
Education Association.

/ Piranga olivacea binomial_au

thority / /Gmelin, 1789/
// The /Scarlet Tanager/, Piranga olivacea, is a medium/sized son

gbird of the
Tanager family, /Thraupidae/.

Adults have pale stout smooth bills. Adult mal

es are bright red with black wings
and tail/ females are yellowish on the underparts and o

live on top, with olive/
brown wings and tail. The adult male/s winter plumage is similar 

to the
female/s, but the wings and tail remain darker.

Their breeding habitat is large fo

rested areas, especially with oaks, across
eastern North America. They build a cup nest on

 a horizontal tree branch.

These birds migrate to northwestern South America. This tanage

r is an extremely
rare vagrant to western Europe.

These birds are often out of sight, for

aging high in trees, sometimes flying out
to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat inse

cts and berries.

These birds do best in the forest interior, where they are less exposed 

to
predators and nest parasitism by the Brown/headed Cowbird. Their numbers are
declining 

in some areas due to forest fragmentation.

Interesting Scarlet Tanager Facts The Scarlet 

Tanager is the only species of
Tanagers that undergo seasonal changes in its plumage. Each

 fall, the male
Scarlet Tanager changes his strikingly beautiful red and black plumage to 

a more
drab olive green similar to the female/s plumage.

The Scarlet Tanager influenced A

nton//n Dvo////k/s String Quartet No. 12 in F
major, Opus 96 /the /American/ String Quarte

t/. Dvo////k heard the bird singing
while trying to work on his composition. Though rather

 irritated by the
distraction, he based the main theme of the scherzo on the bird/s song.
