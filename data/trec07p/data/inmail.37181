 Flea  is the common name for any of the small wingless insects of the order
 Siphonaptera   some authorities use the name  Aphaniptera  because it is older,
but names above family rank do not follow the rules of priority, so most
taxonomists use the more familiar name . Fleas are external parasites, living by
hematophagy off the blood of mammals and birds, and genetic and morphological
evidence indicates that they are descendants of the Scorpionfly family Boreidae,
which are also flightless  accordingly it is possible that they will eventually
be reclassified as a suborder within the Mecoptera. In the past, however, it was
most commonly supposed that fleas had evolved from the flies  Diptera , based on
similarities of the larvae.

Note  There is also a genus of foraminiferan Protozoa named Siphonaptera

Some well known flea species include 
      Cat flea  Ctenocephalides felis ,
      Dog flea  Ctenocephalides canis ,
      Human flea  Pulex irritans ,
      Northern rat flea  Nosopsyllus fasciatus ,
      Oriental rat flea  Xenopsylla cheopis .


Morphology and behavior drawing of a flea in [[Micrographia]]]] Fleas are small
 1 16 to 1 8 inch  1.5 to 3.3 mm  long , agile, usually dark coloured  e.g. the
reddish brown of the cat flea , wingless insects with tube like mouthparts
adapted to feeding on the blood of their hosts. Their bodies are laterally
compressed,  i.e., flattened side to side  permitting easy movement through the
hairs  or feathers etc.  on the host s body. Their legs are long, the hind pair
well adapted for jumping  vertically up to seven inches  18 cm   horizontally
thirteen inches  33 cm  ref name Ohio  [http   ohioline.osu.edu hyg 
fact 2000 2081.html Fleas, HYG 2081 97] William F. Lyon, Ohio State University
entomology page. Accessed 28 December 2006  ref     around 200 times their own
body length. The flea body is hard, polished, and covered with many hairs and
short spines directed backward ref name Florida [http   edis.ifas.ufl.edu IG087
Fleas]   P.G. Koehler and F. M. Oi. Printed July 1993, revised February 2003.
Provided by the University of Florida  ref , allowing the flea a smooth passage
through the hairs of its host. Its tough body is able to withstand great
pressure, likely an adaptation to survive scratching etc. Even hard squeezing
between the fingers is often insufficient to kill the flea  it may be necessary
to crush them between the fingernails.

Fleas lay tiny white oval shaped eggs. Their larvae are small and pale with
bristles covering their worm like body. They are without eyes, and have
mouthparts adapted to chewing. While the adult flea s diet consists solely of
blood, their larvae feed on various organic matter including the feces of mature
fleas. ref name BugGuide [http   bugguide.net node view 7040 Order Siphonaptera
  Fleas   BugGuide.Net] Accessed 28 December 2006  ref  In the pupae phase the
larvae are enclosed in a silken, debris covered cocoon.

Life cycle and habitat Fleas are holometabolous insects, going through the four
life cycle stages of embryo, larva, pupa and imago  adult . The flea life cycle
begins when the female lays after feeding. Adult fleas must feed on blood before
they can become capable of reproduction. ref name  Florida     Eggs are laid in
batches of up to 20 or so, usually on the host itself, which easily roll onto
the ground. As such, areas where the host rests and sleeps become one of the
primary habitats of eggs and developing fleas. The eggs take around two days to
two weeks to hatch re</STYLE>
