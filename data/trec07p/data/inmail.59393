Paul put his hands on the wheels of the chair, not at all sure where he intended to go or what, if anything, he meant to do when he got there - to the kitchen for a knife, perhaps? She recoiled from him in surprise and unease, the last of that blackness going out of her face, and all that was left was that weird little-girl look, that Ive-been-naughty look.

Sincerely,
Nora Weston
