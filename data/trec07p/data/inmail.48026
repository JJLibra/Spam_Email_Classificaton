 Crickets , family  Gryllidae   also known as  true crickets  , are insects
somewhat related to grasshoppers and more closely related to katydids or bush
crickets  order Orthoptera . They have somewhat flattened bodies and long
antennae.

Crickets mate in the spring and lay their eggs in September. The eggs hatch in
the fall and they usually hatch in groups of 2,000.

Crickets are known for their chirp  which only male crickets can do  male wings
have ridges or  teeth  that act like a  comb and file  instrument . The left
forewing has a thick rib  a modified vein  which bears 50 to 300 minute  teeth .
The chirp is generated by raising their left forewing to a 45 degree angle and
rubbing it against the upper hind edge of the right forewing, which has a thick
scraper  Berenbaum 1995 . This sound producing action is called  stridulation 
and the song is species specific. There are two types of cricket songs  a
calling song and a courting song. The calling song attracts females and repels
other males, and is fairly loud. The courting song is used when a female cricket
is near, and is a very quiet song. Female crickets have a long needlelike egg 
laying organ  ovipositor .

Crickets chirp at different rates depending on their species and the temperature
of their environment. Most species chirp at higher rates the higher the
temperature is  approx. 60 chirps a minute at 13  C in one common species  each
species has its own rate . The relationship between temperature and the rate of
chirping is known as Dolbear s Law. In fact, according to this law, it is
possible to calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit by adding 39 to the number
of chirps produced in 15 seconds by the snowy t</STYLE>

/Aesop/ /also spelled ///sop/, from the Greek ///polytonic//////////

/////////
/mdash/ /Ais//pos//, known only for the genre of fables ascribed to him, was by


tradition a slave ////////////// who was a contemporary of Croesus and
Peisistratus in the

 mid/sixth century B.C. in ancient Greece. The various
collections that go under the rubri

c /Aesop/s Fables/ are still taught as moral
lessons and used as subjects for various ente

rtainments, especially children/s
plays and cartoons. Most of what are known as Aesopic fa

bles is a compilation of
tales from various sources, many of which originated with authors

 who lived long
before Aesop. The roots of fables go back all the way to India, where they

 were
associated with Kasyapa, a mystical sage, and they were subsequently adopted by
the 

early Buddhists. Nearly three hundred years later, some of these fables made
their way to 

Alexandria. This collection introduced the use of the moral to sum
up the teaching of a fa

ble, which is similar to the ///gatha/// of the Jatakas.
Aesop himself is said to have com

posed many fables, which were passed down by
oral tradition. Socrates was thought to have 

spent his time turning Aesop///s
fables into verse while he was in prison. Demetrius Phale

reus, another Greek
philosopher, made the first collection of these fables around 300 B.C.

 This was
later translated into Latin by Phaedrus, a slave himself, around 25 B.C. The
