*** SUPER SHORT SQUEEZE REPORT ***
Paivis Corp (OTCBB: PAVC) IS SHORT APPOX 10,500,000 SHARES.

This is our first report to publish in 18 months; it took us almost
1 and a half years to find another HUGE opportunity for our=20
investment community.

Paivis Corp (OTCBB: PAVC) has a short position of approximately 10
million shares. The shorter sellers are expected to begin covering
during the next 5 trading sessions very heavily. We expect this one=20
to hit as high as 6.25 a share in the next 5 trading sessions, as
these short positions are being covered. We saw Paivis trading as
low as .18 last week as short sellers pounded the stock yet again.
Now we are seeing it climb up to the .39 per share mark.=20

Our first SQUEEZE trigger price of 1.05 is expected to be reached
as soon as Thursday, and then Friday we should pull through the
next two squeeze trigger prices of 1.41 and 1.63. When this happens
it will cause the massive volume spike and price increases as short=20
sellers must cover their positions.
