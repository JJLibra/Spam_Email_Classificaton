 Lawnside  is a Borough in Camden County, New Jersey, United States. As of the
United States 2000 Census, the borough population was 2,692.

The land that became Lawnside was purchased by Abolitionists for freed and
escaped slaves, as well as other African Americans, in 1840.

On April 20, 1926, an  Official Special Election  was held in the Borough of
Lawnside. Just one month earlier, on March 24, 1926, Governor of New Jersey A.
Harry Moore signed into law New Jersey General Assembly Bill 561, dissolving
Centre Township, of which Lawnside was a part, and incorporating the Borough of
Lawnside, which also included portions of the borough of Barrington. ref
name Story  The Story of New Jersey s Civil Boundaries  1606 1968 , John P.
Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography  Trenton, New Jersey  1969. p.
107.  ref  With that First Election, Lawnside was propelled into the local and
national spotlight and claimed a place in history, becoming the first
independent self governing African American community north of the Mason Dixon
line.

Lawnside is home to a massive United Parcel Service depot.

Sherron Rolax made his home on Oak Avenue in Lawnside before going to prison.
Rolax achieved public fame when his civil rights were allegedly violated by then
New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman in 1996. The Governor was riding
along in a police patrol car when the police officers stopped Rolax for
suspicious activity in Camden, New Jersey  they frisked him, but found nothing.
Whitman then also frisked the suspect while a state trooper photographed her,
and the image of the smiling governor frisking the suspect was published in
newspapers statewide. The photo drew fire from civil rights leaders who saw this
as a violation of Rolax s civil rights and an endorsement of racial profiling by
the Governor.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of
3.6 km    1.4 mi   , all land.
