having a largely unaltered medieval street plan. The town centre features many
historic buildings, including several timber framed examples from the 15th and
16th centuries. Today, lying 9 miles east of the Welsh border, Shrewsbury serves
as a retail centre for the county and mid Wales. There are some light industry
and distribution centres, mainly on the outskirts. The A5 and A49 trunk roads
cross here, as do a number of railway lines at Shrewsbury railway station.

History and The Square.]] with the Music Hall on the left.]]




Shrewsbury s name comes from the Anglo Saxon Scrobbesburh  dative Scrobbesbyrig 
   fort in the scrub land region  or  Scrobb s fort . Its Welsh name Amwythig
means  fortified place .

Shrewsbury is popularly known as a medieval town, having been founded c.800 and
it was during the  late Middle Ages   14th/15th Centuries  in which the town was
at its height in terms of national importance and wealth. This was mainly due to
the wool trade, a major industry at the time, with the rest of Britain and
Europe, especially with the River Severn and Watling Street as trading routes.
The town was little affected by the industrial revolution, despite the proximity
to Coalbrookdale and Ironbridge, commonly known as the birthplaces of industry.

Shrewsbury has also played a unique part in Western intellectual history, by
being the town in which the great naturalist Charles Darwin was born and raised.

See also   Pengwern   possible ancient town or kingdom based where Shrewsbury is
now.  Battle of Shrewsbury  1403    fought a few miles north of the town centre,
at Battlefield.  Wroxeter   5 miles SW of the town lies the  now ruined  Roman
city of Viroconium Cornoviorum.

Population

The population of the town of Shrewsbury is a little over 70,000 although the
population of the borough of Shrewsbury and Atcham is higher, at just under
96,000. In 1981 the population of the town was 57,731 and in 1991 the population
of the town was 64,219. Shrewsbury is Shropshire s second largest town, below
Telford and ahead of Oswestry. In 2000 and again in 2002, Shrewsbury
unsuccessfully applied for city status.

Within the borough, but not part of the town of Shrewsbury, is the large village
of Bayston Hill. This was once a much smaller village but has grown up to become
a suburb of the town. It remains, however, a separate entity to the town, with
its own parish council, etc. Bayston Hill lies some 3 miles south of the town
centre of Shrewsbury and on the A49 and near to the A5. The smaller village of
Battlefield, this time to the north of the town, is also considered now as a
suburb of the town due to recent growth in the surrounding area. It is covered
by the unparished town area of the borough and is included in a town ward.

Attractions


The historic town centre still retains its medieval street pattern and many
narrow streets and passages. Some of the passages, especially those which pass
through buildings from one street to the next, are called    shuts     a
suggestion is that this is because they were once shut at night . Many
specialist shops, traditional pubs and local restaurants can be found in the
hidden corners, squares and lanes of Shrewsbury. Many of the street names have
also remained unchanged in centuries and there are some more unusual names, such
as Butcher Row, Longden Coleham, Dogpole, Mardol, Frankwell, Roushill, Grope
Lane, Gullet Passage, Murivance, The Dana, Portobello, Bear Steps, Shoplatch and
Bellstone.

There are some very old public houses, which have been continuously open as
pubs, such as the Golden Cross  established 1428   the oldest pub in the town ,
the Dun Cow and the King s Head.

In the centre of the town lies The Quarry. This 29 acre  120,000 m    riverside
park attracts thousands of people throughout the year and is enjoyed as a place
of recreation. The town is known as the  Town of Flowers  and this was the motto
printed onto many of the signs as you entered the town on major roads, although
these were rebranded in 2007 as  The Birthplace of Charles Darwin .

Shrewsbury is home to one of the largest and oldest horticultural events in the
UK   the annual Shrewsbury Flower Show  [http //www.shrewsburyflowershow.org.uk
Shrewsbury Flower Show website] . A two day event, the Flower Show takes place
in mid August, has been running for more than 125 years, and attracts around
100,000 visitors each year. Set in the Quarry park, there are a multitude of
events, exhibitions and displays, with a magnificent fireworks display </STYLE>

The /Savannah Sparrow/ /Passerculus sandwichensis/ is a smal

l sparrow. It is the
only member of the genus Passerculus /Bonaparte, 1838/. Recent compar

ison of
mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and 3 sequences /Zink et al., 2005/ indicates
t

hat the /Ipswich Sparrow/, formerly usually considered a good species /as
Passerculus prin

ceps/, is a well/marked subspecies of the Savannah Sparrow,
whereas the 2 southwestern sub

species should be recognized as distinct species.

This passerine bird breeds in Alaska, C

anada, northern, central and Pacific
coastal USA, Mexico and Guatemala. The Pacific and Me

xican breeders are
resident, but other populations are migratory, wintering from the south

ern
United States to northern South America. It is a very rare vagrant to western
Europe.



Savannah Sparrow is a very variable species, with numerous races, several of
which have b

een split as separate species at various times. The different forms
vary principally in th

e darkness of the plumage, with Alaskan and interior races
the palest, and southern Pacifi

c coastal forms the darkest.

This species has a typically sparrow/like dark/streaked brow

n back, and whitish
underparts with brown or blackish breast and flank streaking. It has y

ellowish
or whitish crown and eyebrow stripes. The cheeks are brown and the throat white.



The breeding habitat is a wide variety of open habitats including grasslands and
cultivat

ion. Savannah Sparrows nest on the ground, laying 3/6 eggs in a cup nest
sheltered by a cl

ump of grass or other vegetation. They form flocks in the
winter to migrate.

These birds 

forage on the ground or in low bushes. They mainly eat seeds, but
insects are also eaten i

n the breeding season. The song is mixture of chips and
trills. The flight call is a thin 

seep.

This bird was named after Savannah, Georgia where one of the first specimens of
thi

s bird was collected.

Although this bird is generally abundant across its range, some coa

stal
populations depending on salt marsh habitat are declining.

Fifteen subspecies plus t

he two Large/billed Sparrows are currently recognized.
Four additional subspecies are not 

generally accepted. The subspecies are
usually divided into several groups/

/ The Savanna

h Sparrows proper /migratory// // P. s. labradorius, breeds in
  Newfoundland, Labrador, a

nd N Quebec // P. s. oblitus, breeds in N Ontario and
  Manitoba // P. s. savanna //Easter

P. s. nevadensis, breeds in the N Great Plains and the
  Great Basin // P. s. brunnescens,

 breeds from central Mexico south to
  Guatemala /includes P. s. rufofuscus/
P. s. wetmore

i is a doubtful subspecies which may breed in the mountains of
   Guatemala. It is known f

rom only 5 specimens, collected June 11/17, 1897, in
   Huehuetenango Department.

/ The /

Ipswich Sparrow/ /formerly considered a distinct species / see Zink et
  al., 2005 /, some

 post/breeding dispersal/ // P. s. princeps, breeds almost
  exclusively on Sable Island



/ The Belding/s Savannah Sparrows /resident// // P. s. beldingi, resident on the
  Pacific

 Coast from Morro Bay, California, to El Rosario, Baja California
  /includes P. s. bryant

i/ // P. s. anulus, resident around Sebasti//n Vizca//no
  Bay, Baja California // P. s. g

uttatus, resident around San Ignacio Lagoon //
  P. s. magdalenae, resident around Magdale

na Bay

/ The /San Benito Savannah Sparrow/ /resident/ // P. s. sanctorum, Islas San
  Ben

itos

The Savannah Sparrows proper are very similar and migrant birds can not usually
be r

elated to a breeding population with certainty. The resident or partially
migratory subspe

cies are well distinguishable by size and, particularly between
groups, coloration. The Ip

swich Sparrow is somewhat larger and paler in colour
than other eastern Savannah Sparrows.

 The breast streaks are narrower and pale
brown. Some birds overwinter on the island/ othe

rs migrate south along the
Atlantic coast, usually departing later and returning sooner th

an mainland
birds. Some birds interbreed with P. s. savanna in Nova Scotia. These birds
fr

equently raise three broods in a year. This bird was first observed in winter
on the dunes

 near the town of Ipswich, Massachusetts.

The /[[Large/billed Sparrow]]s/, best considere

d a distinct species /Zink et al,
