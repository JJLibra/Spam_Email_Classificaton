wow, qualifies as one of the dumbest statements ever made on the internet. 

In the United States, you can recover from all of these. Getting laid off isn't even stigmatized anymore. Drilling in the idea that this is a country that lets people take a mulligan will make it a hotbed of innovation. 

Then Linkin Park's head of security, Bruce Thompson, got an email from someone purporting to be Talinda. "Hi Bruce," it read, "do we have an email address for Samantha? Strange emails from (fan?) sources have been received. They seem to know a lot of information." Somebody was pretending to be Chester's current wife to get contact info for his ex. 

For the universities, this is a way to get students that otherwise couldn't get to the States because of financial issues or visa problems. It's also a way to take advantage of well-known brand names in nations filled with ambitious and wealthy people. But for U.S. citizens, it's not the best news: now you don't have to live here to attend our best schools. 

2. Issue green cards like mad. One of the more forward-looking proposals now being bandied about Congress would give green cards to foreign students in Master's or Ph.D. programs in the sciences, engineering or math. In some cases, green cards can be given to undergraduates too. Last year, Scalise gave speeches at Tsinghua University and Fudan University. At both places, the first questions from students were the same: how can we obtain visas?
