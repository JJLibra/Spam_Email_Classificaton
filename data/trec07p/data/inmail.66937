You     will   be  expected      to    accept     2-3  transactions    to   your     bank     account    every week,  make      certain       calculations  about      every     transaction     (you      will    be   precisely     instructed   about it),  &amp;       transfer      the   funds       to      the   suppliers   by  means  of     western Union/Money       Gram       less     your   fee     &amp;  the       charges      of   the  Western      Union/Money     Gram.  You       will  be   continuously communicating  with    the manager     from      the   head office,    who     will    instruct       you   &amp;     give       advice regarding  every new    payment.<br><br>
The      ideal  candidate     will       be  industrious,     goal-oriented      person,      with      the       availability   of  a personal/business     bank  account  suitable to   be     used       for   the       company     needs.
