Dear valued member.
This letter is a piece of advice by IPN (Internet Pharmacy Network) – officially registered organization dealing with the problem of mass drug falsification.
There are so many online drugstores on the Web today – but not all of them are as reliable as one might want them to be. Actually, only a few of them (for example, USDrugs) sell 100% generic meds – so you have to be really careful while choosing where to buy your pills.
Hope that you take our advice seriously. Take care.
