    Potsdam  is the capital city of the federal state of Brandenburg in Germany.
It is situated on the Havel River, southwest of Berlin. It is a part of the
Metropolitan area Berlin/Brandenburg.

Potsdam is known as the former residence of the Prussian kings until 1918. The
city features a series of interconnected lakes and unique cultural landscapes,
in particular the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, the largest World Heritage
Sites in Germany.

The Potsdam district of Babelsberg also serves as one of the leading centers of
European film production. The Filmstudio Babelsberg has significant historical
value as the oldest large scale film studio in the world. The Deutsches
Filmorchester Babelsberg frequently records soundtracks for domestic and foreign 
based film productions.

The city developed into a center of science in Germany since the 19th century.
Today there are 3 public High schools and more than 30 research institutes in
Potsdam.

Geography

Potsdam is situated south west of Berlin. The area was formed from a series of
large moraines during the last ice age. Today the city consists of 75  green
area, with just 25  covered with buildings or streets. There are about 20 lakes
and rivers in Potsdam, for example the Havel, the Griebnitzsee, Templiner See,
Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See and the Sacrower See. The
tallest hill is the 114 meter high Kleiner Ravensberg.

Potsdam is divided into 7 historic city districts and 9 new Ortsteile  village
parts , which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city districts is
quite different. The districts in the north and the in the center consist mainly
of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of
newer buildings.

History in 993 mentioning Poztupimi.]] ]] Potsdam was probably founded in the
7th century as a Slavic village called Poztupimi, centred on a castle. A
possible translation of the name might be beneath the oaks. It was first
mentioned in writing in 993, and by 1317 it was mentioned as a small town, by
now German, which gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573 it was still a small
market town of 2000 inhabitants. The Thirty Years  War  1618   1648  destroyed
nearly half the town.

Potsdam s fortunes changed dramatically when it was chosen in 1660 as the
hunting residence of Frederick William I, elector of Brandenburg, the core of
the powerful state that later became the Kingdom of Prussia. It also housed a
Prussian barracks.

After the Edict of Potsdam in 1685 Potsdam became a centre of European
immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from France  Huguenots ,
Russia, the Netherlands, and Bohemia. The edict allowed a faster population
growth and a recovery of the economy.

Later the city was adopted as a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The
majestic buildings of the royal residence were built mainly during the reign of
Frederick the Great. One of these buildings is the Sanssouci Palace  French 
 without cares , by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744 , famed for its
formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other buildings in the royal residence
complex include the Neues Palais and the Orangery.

While Berlin was the official capital of Prussia and later of the German Empire,
the court remained in nearby Potsdam, where many government officials settled.
In 1914 the Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the New Palace
in Potsdam. The city lost this status as a second capital in 1918, when World
War I ended and Wilhelm II abdicated.

A /pear/ is 

a tree of the genus Pyrus and the juicy fruit of that tree, edible
in some species. The En

glish word pear is probably from Common West Germanic
/pera, probably a loanword of Vulgar

 Latin pira, the plural of pirum, which is
itself of unknown origin. See also Peor//. The 

place name //Perry// can indicate
the historical presence of pear trees.

The pear is memb

er of the natural order Rosaceae, belonging to the same genus as
the apple /P. malus/, whi

ch it resembles in floral structure. In both cases the
so/called fruit is composed of the 

receptacle or upper end of the flower/stalk
/the so/called calyx tube/ greatly dilated, an

d enclosing within its cellular
flesh the five cartilaginous carpels which constitute the 

/core/ and are really
the true fruit. From the upper rim of the receptacle are given off t

he five
sepals, the five petals, and the very numerous stamens. Another major relative
of 

the pear /and thus the apple/ is the quince.

The form of the pear and of the apple respec

tively, although usually
characteristic enough, is not by itself sufficient to distinguish

 them, for
there are pears which cannot by form alone be distinguished from apples, and
ap

ples which cannot by superficial appearance be recognized from pears. The main
distinction

 is the occurrence in the tissue of the fruit, or beneath the rind,
of clusters of cells f

illed with hard woody deposit in the case of the pear,
constituting the /grit,/ while in t

he apple no such formation of woody cells
takes place. The appearance of the tree/mdash/th

e bark, the foliage, the
flowers/mdash/is, however, usually quite characteristic in the tw

o species.

Cultivated pears, whose number is enormous, are without doubt derived from one


or two wild species widely distributed throughout Europe and western Asia, and
sometimes 

forming part of the natural vegetation of the forests. In England,
where the pear is somet

imes considered wild, there is always the doubt that it
may not really be so, but the prod

uce of some seed of a cultivated tree
deposited by birds or otherwise, which has degenerat

ed into the wild spine/
bearing tree known as //Pyrus communis//.

The cultivation of the 

pear extends to the remotest antiquity. Traces of it have
been found in the Swiss lake/dwe

llings/ it is mentioned in the oldest Greek
writings, and was cultivated by the Romans. Th

e word /pear/ or its equivalent
occurs in all the Celtic languages, while in Slavonic and 

other dialects
different appellations, but still referring to the same thing, are found/nd

ash/a
diversity and multiplicity of nomenclature which led Alphonse de Candolle to
infer a

 very ancient cultivation of the tree from the shores of the Caspian to
those of the Atlan

tic. A certain race of pears, with white down on the under
surface of their leaves, is sup

posed to have originated from P. nivalis, and
their fruit is chiefly used in France in the

 manufacture of Perry /see Cider/.
Other small/fruited pears, distinguished by their preco

city and apple/like
fruit, may be referred to P. cordate, a species found wild in western 

France,
and in Devonshire and Cornwall.

Botany Pears are native to coastal and mildly tem

perate regions of the Old
World, from western Europe and north Africa east right across As

ia. They are
medium sized trees, reaching 10/17 m tall, often with a tall, narrow crown/ a


few species are shrubby. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, 2/12 cm
long, gloss

y green on some species, densely silvery/hairy in some others/ leaf
shape varies from broa

d oval to narrow lanceolate. Most pears are deciduous, but
one or two species in southeast

 Asia are evergreen. Most are cold/hardy,
withstanding temperatures between /minus/25 //C 

and /minus/40 //C in winter,
except for the evergreen species, which only tolerate tempera

tures down to about
/minus/15 //C.

The flowers are white, rarely tinted yellow or pink, 2

/4 cm diameter, and have
five petals. Like that of the related apple, the pear fruit is a 

pome, in most
wild species 1/4 cm diameter, but in some cultivated forms up to 18 cm long 

and
8 cm broad/ the shape varies from globose in most species, to the classic /pear/
shape

/ of the European Pear with an elongated basal portion and a bulbous end.

The pear is ver

y similar to the apple in cultivation, propagation and
pollination.

There are about 30 sp

ecies of pears. Selected species //

<Geography

Potsdam is situated south /> west of Berlin. The area was f<rmed from a series of
large/>e moraines during the last ic< age. Today the city consists of 75  gre/>een
area, with just 25  covered<with />buildings or streets.< There are abou/>ut 20 lakes
and<rivers in Potsdam, for example the Ha/>avel, the Griebnitzsee, <T/>T<mpliner />See,<
Tiefer See, /> Jungfernsee, Telt<wkanal, Heiliger See an/>nd the Sacrowe< See. The
ta/>allest hill is the <14 meter high Kleiner Ravensberg.

/>
P<otsdam is d/>divided into<7 historic city districts and 9 new Ort/>steile  village
parts , which joi<n/>ned the city in 2003< The appearance /> of the city districts is
quite <iffer/>rent. The< districts in />the north and the in the center consist<m/>ainly
of historical buildings, t<e so/>outh of the city is do<minated by larger areas of
newer buil/>ldings.

History in 993<m/>mention<ng Poztupimi.]] ]] Potsdam was/>s probably founded in the
7th centur< as a Slavic/> village called Poz<tupimi, centred/> on a castle. A
possible transla<ion of the name might be beneath t/>the oaks. It was firs<
mentioned in writing /> in 993, and <y 1317 it was mentioned as a/>a small town, by
now German, w<hich gained its town charter in 1/>345. In 1573 it was still a small
<arket town of 2000 inhabitants. T/>The Thirty Years  War  1618   1648  dest<oyed
near/>ly half the town.

Potsdam < fortunes changed dramatically when /> it was chosen in 1660 as the
huntin<g /> residence of Frederi<k William I, elector of />Brandenburg, the <core of
the powerful state that/>t later became the Kingdom <f Prussia. It also hous/>ed a
Prussian barracks.

After the Edic< of Potsdam in 1685 P/>P<ot/>tsdam bec<ame a centre of E/>urope<an
immigration. Its religious freedom/>m attracted people from Franc<  Huguenots ,
R/>Russia, the Netherland<, and Bohemia. The edict allowed a fast/>ter <population
growth and a recovery/> of the economy.

Later the <ity was adopted as a full residenc/>ce of the Prussian royal family. Th<e
majestic buil/>ldings of the royal residence were <built mainly />during the <reign of
Frederick the Great. One />of these b<uildings is the Sanssouci Pa/>alace  French 
 without care< ,/> by Georg W<enzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744 , />famed for <its
form/>al gardens and R<ococo interiors. O/>ther buildings in the <ro/>oyal residence
complex include t<he Neues />Palais and the Orangery<.

While Berlin was the officia/>a< capital of Pru/>ssia <and later of the German Empire,
the/> court remained in ne<rby Potsdam, where many governme/>nt officials settled.
In 1914 th< Emperor Wilhelm II /> signed the Declarati<n of War in the New Palace
in Potsdam/>m. The city lost this status as a second< capital in 1918,/> when Wo<rld
War I ende/>d <and Wil/>helm II abdicated.
