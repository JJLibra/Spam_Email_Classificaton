Discoveries in physics find applications throughout the other natural sciences as they regard the basic constituents of the Universe. Experimental physicists design and perform experiments with particle accelerators, nuclear reactors, telescopes, barometers, synchrotrons, cyclotrons, spectrometers, lasers, and other equipment.
