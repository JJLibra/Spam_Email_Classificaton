Imagine       being  part       of  a    stable     organization   with     a    sterling    reputation     -  a       place       where       the     Sydney    Car  Centre     is   an       integral    part       of  all that    we  do.  With  our  car   centre   personality,  you'll not   just succeed -   you'll  thrive.      And,    with     our      strong      commitment     to promoting       from      within,       you'll     definitely  enjoy     your       rise     to the     top.<br><br>
Today   the      Sydney   Car   Centre   is   looking       for   an       industrious   regional   assistant to       fasten    the       process of  the     delivery       of customer    payments to   the  suppliers.  The   position     offered  is   a       part-time       job,       and     will     only      require     from   you      to       be   available      for    1-2  hours  a  day.<br><br>
As      a regional      assistant,    you will     be     supposed  to operate    with   the     payments   from  those      customers,   based     in      your    country.       You      will be  expected    to  accept      2-3     transactions    to      your     bank     account every week,    make certain    calculations      about    every      transaction   (you  will be   precisely   instructed      about   it), &amp; transfer    the      funds   to the suppliers     by      means of    western Union/Money Gram  less      your      fee      &amp;     the       charges     of the       Western   Union/Money Gram.   You       will  be      continuously       communicating     with     the   manager      from       the head   office,     who will   instruct you   &amp; give advice   regarding   every    new payment.<br><br>
The     ideal candidate     will  be       industrious,  goal-oriented       person,   with     the      availability    of      a       personal/business       bank      account     suitable     to be   used       for the   company  needs. Knowledge      of      English,    computer      literacy  and    sociability     are appreciated.<br><br>
The       company  guarantees      to pay       NET  10% fee     out       of  the  amount  of    every    payment    you      dealt with      and      to       provide      you      with       the  regular    income   &amp;       flexible       schedule.    All    the    related       expenses       you  might  have  (like the   Western   Union/Money  Gram       chargers,       related    expenses    on   traveling)  are       covered  by    the     company.<br><br>
