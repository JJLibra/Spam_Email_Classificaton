<=21--The four-city push comes as the        FBI is expected to report a 1.3 percent rise in violen=
t crime nationwide in 2006 =E2=80=94 an increase for the second straight year.

At the same time, a new internal Justice report rapped crime-busting task forces for faili=
ng to coordinate efforts and potentially endangering agents' lives.

=22Each of these cities has seen an unacceptable increase in homicides or other violent cr=
imes,=22 Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told employees at the Washington headquarte=
rs of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. =22Authorities in each hav=
e come forward and asked for our help.=22

Defying critics who have demanded his resignation over the firings of U.S. attorneys, Gon=
zales said he would spend the final 18 months of his tenure =22in a sprint=22 to curb violent=
 crime.

The influx of agents brings the number of ATF Violent Crime Impact Teams, which first deplo=
yed three years ago, to 29 cities. The FBI is also adding to its more than 180 Safe Streets Tas=
k Forces by sending one to Orlando, which Gonzales said has been plagued by gang violence.

Orlando police spokeswoman Barbara Jones said the department =22welcomes any additiona=
l federal support in our efforts to combat violent crime.=22

No additional funds or grants are expected to be funneled to communities to bolster their o=
wn law enforcement efforts, Justice officials said. Gonzales also called anew for new law=
s to strengthen penalties against criminals, including imposing mandatory minimum sent=
ences on federal convicts.
