Hello!
  My name is Elena, I which girl of 26 years, I was born on June,
  27, 1980 in city Kazan in Russia, my growth of 173 sm, my weight of 63
  kg. I investigated English language in institute, I studied there as
  the architect, but have then connected the life with Landscape
  designer. I write to you this letter in full despair. The matter is
  that I have got acquainted with the man through the Internet. I
  corresponded with him many months, we very well understood each other,
  and during our dialogue became very much close people. I have
  understood, that we need to receive a meeting, in fact, one real
  meeting, can tell about the person, it is more than thousand letters.
  I began to prepare for documents for departure Russia. While we
  communicated, I saved money for travel. I worked much, I make
  everything what to earn money for the trip. I went to the purpose, and
  I her have achieved! But when I have written him that have invited me
  in embassy, concerning consultation for reception of the visa. he has
  told that all this was for him game. he received pleasure from
  dialogue, but he did not think, that my intentions were very serious.
  Then I have received the letter where he wrote &quot; that him is very a
  pity, he the married person and is happy in marriage ". When I have
  written him a question why he so severely played with me. he has
  ceased to write and began to ignore my letters which I wrote. I write
  to you this letter, with hope that you will answer me! A problem that
  in a week I shall receive the visa. I do not want to cancel trip from
  for this cowardly loser. I not when was not abroad Russia, and it was
  very pleasant for me to look the country. I want to tell to you, that
  I have all necessary what to arrive to you. Whether I simply want ask
  you I can to make it?! I understand, that this offer can be very
  interesting and strange simultaneously. But very much frequently, the
  life, brings to us surprises which we simply do not wait. And now at
  us two such surprise. My heart prompts me, that we could take pleasure
  in dialogue, pleasantly spend. Together we could embellish our boring
  life. Now I am in Moscow, I live here in cheap hotel as I have no
  relatives in Moscow. This week I shall go to receive the visa. I very
  strongly want, that you with understanding would consider my
  situation. I want to look the world, and to see as people live, than
  they are engaged. I shall be simply happy to get acquainted and arrive
  to the person who has rescued me in such difficult situation. I want
  to use one chance which was given to me with my destiny. And who
  knows, this chance be given and to you can. I the usual woman which
  have remained in private, with such big problem. I ask you to
  understand my letter correctly, and to try enter my position. I shall
  be very grateful to you, if you write to me the letter. I can send you
  the picture, that you could see the woman which so has severely been
  deceived. I was to be trusted, that you will not laugh on up to me. I
  hope that you will correctly react to my unexpected letter!!! In fact
  lives it is a strange piece, and not when you do not know, where you
  will find, and where you will lose. That you would think of that that
