I have a great sex life with my wife, but was getting softer over the years. So I decided to try some Viagra. I cut one in half and took it. Ten minutes later my dick was rock hard and I shot my load 10 minutes later. It was very good. I got out of  bed had breakfast. Was looking at a magazine and got another hard on looking at a fully clothed girl in a low cut dress. I went to the bathroom and pulled off again as good as before. From 8.00am to 1.30pm that day I orgasmed 6 times.<br>
