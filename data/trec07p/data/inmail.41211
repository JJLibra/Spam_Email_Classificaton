<P>Dear Memo,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often get chills down my spine when someone tel=
ls me about a birth coincidence like yours.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because&nbsp;when I learned you were born=
 in Edmonton on August 8, 1972, I realized you are one of the people who cou=
ld use the amazing "Angelic Key" I discovered (a medallion with mysterious a=
ncient symbols and incredible power) made of pure 24 karat Gold and pure Ste=
rling Silver,&nbsp;to open a&nbsp;"Portal" to The Archangel Michael.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend, this is a truly rare and magnificent p=
iece that is as beautiful as it is mysterious and magical.&nbsp; It is a med=
allion that is directly linked to the bible itself...a magical object withou=
t peer, and one that until recently has been nearly impossible to obtain.</P=
>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me tell you why this medallion and Archan=
gel Michael, the most powerful of angels, can deliver the miracles, protecti=
on, guidance and love you need to change your life so you can live your drea=
ms. (Not many people can ever hope to be given a chance like this, so please=
 listen carefully.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, your medallion will create a "Portal" (a c=
onnection) to the Archangel Michael, who is considered the greatest, most po=
werful of all angels by <U>each</U> of the world's 3 great religions... Juda=
ism, Christianity and Islam. His power is so great that it is stated in the =
scriptures in each of these 3 great religions, "that those lucky enough to h=
ave Archangel Michael in their lives will receive the blessings and miracles=
 they need to enjoy a better, happier, richer life."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why, for example, since ancient times the=
 Archangel Michael was renowned all over Europe and Russia for his ability t=
o produce miracles. In fact, there was not a city in Russia, where there is =
not a church or chapel dedicated to the Archangel Michael for this very reas=
on.</P>
<P style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, Courier, mono" align=
=3Dcenter><B><U>A piece with extraordinary powers crafted in<BR>Pure 24 kara=
t Gold and Pure Sterling Silver!</U></B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I hope you can now see, this is no ordinary Me=
dallion.&nbsp; And as you can imagine the materials from which it is made ar=
e befitting a piece of this magnitude... Pure 24 karat Gold and Pure Sterlin=
g Silver! The 2 <U>most</U> magically powerful and pure metals in the world!=
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, 24 karat Gold is considered the purest and=
 most magically potent of all metals and has been since the dawn of man. In =
fact, it has been known throughout history that when priests, shamans or mag=
i wear pure gold, it greatly enhances their magical and spiritual powers.</P=
>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, it is thought of as <U>the</U> most=
 protective, since pure 24 karat Gold is one of the basic elements and canno=
t be corroded or corrupted in any way. It is for these reasons, as well for =
its incredible beauty, that through the ages Gold was the material of choice=
 for crafting sacred objects, such as chalices and crosses as well as jewelr=
y. This is why it has been, and continues to be, worn and used in religious =
ceremonies to this day.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps the greatest reason for acquiring Gol=
d over the last four thousand years is that people wear Gold to increase the=
ir own personal power, courage, confidence and will power. It also has the p=
ower to attract wealth. (Ever heard the expression, "money attracts money?" =
Well before there was money it was believed that Gold attracted Gold. This i=
s the reason it has been so sought after and hoarded.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons Solid 24 karat Gold was <U>=
essential</U> for this incredible piece.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Pure Sterling Silver was used because it =
is the most powerfully mysterious and spiritually absorbing material on Eart=
h. It is also the second most protective metal. In fact, because of Silver's=
 amazing ability to protect and heal, hospital dressings containing silver a=
re used on burns to prevent infections.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is only the tip of the iceberg, because =
Pure Sterling Silver also enhances and empowers psychic abilities and intuit=
ive perception. What's more, Silver's relaxed, reflective energy <I>magnifie=
s</I> the powers of the Pure 24 karat Gold.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means your Medallion of the Archangel Michae=
l, which was cast in pure Sterling Silver, will magnify the Pure 24 karat Go=
ld's magical properties many times over! (Can you now begin to see how truly=
 wonderful, beautiful and powerful this piece is?)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there's more! A lot more, because this exquis=
ite piece contains some of the most <U>powerful</U> symbols ever created for=
 a Medallion or any other religious or magical piece...</P>

<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if you look at the medallion you will see=
 the secret angelic prayer inscribed in 24 karat Gold around its perimeter. =
It is written in Enochian, the language of angels, so no one but you will be=
 able to use it. I will send you this secret prayer with your medallion. You=
 must recite it three times.&nbsp; This will charge your medallion and open =
a "Portal" to the angels. (Please keep this a secret.)<BR><BR></TD>

<TD vAlign=3Dtop>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, notice Archangel Michael's flaming swords=
. These are symbols of righteousness, which he will use to protect you from =
all forms of negative entities. There is one in each quadrant of your Medall=
ion. These quadrants represent the 4 points on a compass. This will protect =
you from harm from any direction as well as attract good fortune and opportu=
nity from any direction.<BR><BR></P></TD></TR>

ealthandhappiness.com/RGEM8114/celtic.knots.jpg" border=3D0></TD>
<TD vAlign=3Dtop><BR>Next, you'll notice the interlacing patterns at the top=
 of each quadrant.&nbsp; These are ancient keltoi knot patterns taken from "=
The book of Kells". They have been used for 1000's of years&nbsp;to trap pow=
erful energies and when grouped with the other elements, they make it possib=
le to "magically" summon spiritual entities, such as the Archangel Michael, =
for help, direction, companionship and miracles. (Which is why I want you to=
 keep your Medallion with you at <U>all</U> times.)<BR><BR></TD></TR>

<TD vAlign=3Dtop width=3D110><IMG alt=3D"" src=3D"https://www2.myhealthwealt=
handhappiness.com/RGEM8114/ley.jpg" border=3D0></TD>
<TD vAlign=3Dtop>Lastly, you will notice the Gold "Ley" lines. ("Ley" is the=
 old Saxon word for "cleared path.") These are "lines of power," as we call =
them today. They are identical to the lines found on Neolithic monuments in =
England. These lines have been used for 1000's of years to guide ancient man=
 to the invisible pathways of energy that connect spiritual powers (like ang=
els) to human beings.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: Right after "charging" your medallion with =
the secret invocation, you could experience a tingling sensation, and notice=
 light glistening and glancing off the surface of this amazing talisman. Wha=
t's more, if you're like others, you will get an incredible feeling of secur=
ity and warmth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, after the initial "charging" when y=
ou feel the need to open a "Portal" to the angels or to Michael himself,&nbs=
p; just "power-up" your Medallion by reciting the secret Enochian prayer aga=
in.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you ever find yourself feeling th=
reatened or uneasy, or if you feel you are lacking the proper commitment, mo=
tivation or direction, or you are at a place where you truly need a miracle =
to solve a problem, or overcome an obstacle that is standing between you and=
 your dreams, just grasp your medallion in your hand and recite the prayer.<=
/P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, should you need to call on the medalli=
on's amazing powers for luck, courage, direction, energy, vitality or if you=
 need to attract money, just recite the prayer. Most importantly, you should=
 keep your medallion with you at <U>all</U> times.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you know you are acquiring a genuine Archa=
ngel Michael Medallion, made from Pure 24 karat Gold and Pure Sterling Silve=
r, yours will arrive with it's own Certificate of Authenticity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since I want you to do this so you'll have th=
e ability to benefit from this connection and your incredible happenstance, =
anywhere, any place, any time, I believe it would be best if you could keep =
the power of Archangel Michael as close to you at all times, so I would like=
 you to have...</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this richly detailed guide will give you a=

r of all the Archangels as well as all the guardian angels and is responsibl=
e for the protection, courage, strength, truth and integrity of all the peop=
le who are able to contact him.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, you'll hear how Archangel Michael's=
 involvement with mankind is also seen in other ways, including his protecti=
on of Jacob from the wrath of his brother Esau over a matter of inheritance.=
 The Scriptures also tell us that it was Michael who battled the Devil for t=
he soul of Moses following the death of the founder of the Israeli nation.</=
P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it shows you how lucky you are to be able=
 to contact him and other angels.</P>

amples of how the Archangel has helped others and explain the secrets of usi=
