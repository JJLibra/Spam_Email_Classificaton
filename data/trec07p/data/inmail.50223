The /Leopar

d/ /Panthera pardus/ is one of the four /big cats/ of the genus
[[Panthera]]. Males can gr

ow to weigh 91 kg /200 lbs/ and the females can weigh
60 kg /132 lbs/ [http///www.sandiego

zoo.org/animalbytes/t/leopard.html].
Originally, it was thought that a leopard was a hybri

d between a lion and a
panther, and the leopard/s common name derives from this belief/ le

o is the
Greek and Latin word for lion /Greek leon, ///////// and pard is an old term
mean

ing panther. In fact, a /panther/ can be any of several species of large
felid. In North A

merica, panther means cougar and in South America a panther is
a jaguar. Elsewhere in the 

world a panther is a leopard. Early naturalists
distinguished between leopards and panther

s not by colour /a common
misconception/, but by the length of the tail /mdash/ panthers h

aving longer
tails than leopards.

Description Although it is common for a leopard to be m

istaken for a cheetah due
to their spots, they can actually be easily distinguished. The l

eopard has a
heavier, stockier body and has a larger head in proportion to its body, and h

as
rosettes rather than dots. Leopards also lack the black /tear/streak/ markings
that run

 from the inner corners of the cheetah/s eyes to the corners of its
mouth. Additionally, c

heetahs run much faster than leopards do and generally do
not climb trees, whereas leopard

s are excellent climbers. Also, leopards are
more active at night searching for their prey

 /nocturnal/, whereas cheetahs are
usually diurnal. /gallery/ Image/Cheetah4.jpg/Cheetah

Behaviour and 

predation Leopards are infamous for their ability to go
undetected. They sometimes live pr

actically among humans and are usually still
tough to spot. They are graceful and stealthy

. Among the big cats they are
