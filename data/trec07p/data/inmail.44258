Dear customer.Various medical associations warn us about the growing problem of drug falsification. If you want to know how to avoid being sold fake medications, red this letter to the end.At CanadianPharmacy you will always be able to find the generic drugs you need and they will be a lot cheaper that those sold in the USA. CanadianPharmacy is a licensed Canadian e-shop, which lets it (and you too) turn the Canadian drug taxation system to its advantage.CanadianPharmacy 100% safety at the lowest price you've ever seen. Only generic drugs on sale.Yours faithfully,Marva Case
