        Dear Reader,

        In a market populated by bold optimism and bright-eyed
        business plans, few companies ascend to the lofty
        precipice of FDA submissions and approvals.  In the
        small cap world, it seems said optimism and genuine
        intent are often the norm with real, marketable
        successes the aberration.

        So, the recent announcement by Imaging3, Inc.
        (OTCBB:IMGG) that it had submitted its innovative
        Dominion™ real-time imaging device to the FDA, stands
        out among many small cap biotechnology and healthcare
        stories, all chasing the enormous Baby Boomer-driven
        market.  While there are no guarantees as to the speed
        or inclination of an FDA response, historically
        responses related to devices are more expeditiously
        considered because they typically do not require human
        trials.

        Having advanced to a position of leadership among
        providers of advanced medical imaging devices over the
        past 14 years, Imaging3 is one of the industry’s most
        respected, long-standing medical device manufacturers,
        distributors and third-party service providers.
        Management indicates that there are currently no direct
        competitors in the marketplace providing the same 3D,
        real-time, high resolution deliverable.

            Imaging3 Files with Federal Drug Administration

           510(k) Application Filed with FDA on June 15, 2007

        BURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Imaging3(TM), Inc.,
        (OTCBB:IMGG - News), developer of a breakthrough
        medical imaging device that produces 3D medical
        diagnostic images of virtually any part of the human
        body in real-time, announced today that the company has
        filed it's 510(k) submission for the Dominion(TM) 3D
        real-time imaging device with the FDA on June 15th as
        promised.

        "I'm pleased to announce that Imaging3 has met its
        filing deadline for submission of the Dominion

        good understanding of what the FDA needs to see in the
        submission and we have kept those needs at the
        forefront throughout the Dominion's development," added
        Mr. Janes. "While there are no guarantees on how long
        this process can take, we have done everything in our
        power to deliver as much data as possible," Mr. Janes
        concluded.

        Imaging3, Inc., OTCBB: IMGG ("Imaging3") was founded in
        1993 and is based in Burbank, California. Imaging3
        became a leading provider of advanced technology
        medical imaging devices. Fourteen years later, Imaging3
        is one of the most respected, long-standing medical
        device manufacturers, distributors and third-party
        service providers in the industry.

        Shortly after the Millennium began Imaging3 began
        looking into the future of medical imaging devices and
        began developing a breakthrough technology, known as
        the Dominion ™, which utilizes high-resolution
        photo-fluoroscopy to produce three-dimensional medical
        diagnostic images, in real-time.

                  [Image]aaaaaaaa[Image]aaaaaaa[Image]

        Imaging3 patented the breakthrough Dominion technology
        and stands to benefit in a multitude of medical
        sectors, including: trauma, cardiology, pain
        management, pediatrics, orthopedics, sports medicine,
        vascular, and neuro-vascular among others.  The
        Dominion’s 3D, real-time imaging capabilities allow
        surgeons to complete less invasive and more precise
        procedures. This ability is valuable to the patient,
        the surgical team, the facility, and the insurer.

        This revolutionary technology represents a turning
        point in medical imaging and will enable new procedures
        not possible today and improve existing procedures
        through increased speed and greater accuracy. The
        Dominion, in addition to 3D real-time fluoroscopic
        imaging, is capable of emulating other imaging
        technology, such as CT scans, and does so at a fraction
        of the cost. The Dominion is mobile, will fit through a
        standard room door, and is powered by a standard wall
        outlet.

                     The Dominion ™ 3D Imaging Unit

        Imaging3 can provide 3D images that are instantly
        constructed in real-time, and can be used for any
        current or new medical procedure in which multiple
        frames of reference are required to perform medical
        procedures on or in the human body.

           Imagine for a moment ... a future healthcare center
                    equipped with Imaging3 devices.
           For the first time ever, healthcare workers will be
                       able to instantly view 3D,
           high-resolution images of virtually any part of the
                              human body.

          "Real-time 3D, as a medium for display and imaging is
                               here now,
         and its effect on technology over the next few decades,

          especially the medical device market, is ushering in
             a broad advancement in the role of radiology.

           "No longer just a diagnostic tool, real-time three
                          dimensional imaging
         is shifting these devices into a proactive role in the
                           operating room.''

           Having the ability to view images of the patient in
              three dimensions in real time could be the
          difference in providing the correct diagnosis ... the
                    difference between life and death

        The Dominion when fully equipped with CT emulation will
        sell for approximately $500,000 and the standard
        Dominion with real-time 3D imaging will sell in the
        $200,000 range.  The Dominion with CT capabilities
        costs about 1/3 the price of a dedicated CT machine but
        with the added advantage that it can be used in areas
        where CT is not currently available such as the
        operating and emergency rooms.  This is due to the
        Dominion’s mobility, small footprint and that it
        provides doctors with superior access to the patient
        than current CT or MRI machines do.  The Dominion does
        far more and for far less.

                          No Direct Competitors

        At this time, the Company's management is not aware of
        any existing devices in the marketplace that provide
        3D, real-time diagnostic medical imaging, with the
        exception of ultrasound. Ultrasound is a real-time
        tomgraphic imaging modality. Not only does it produce
        real-time tomograms of the position of reflecting
        surfaces (internal organs and structures), but also it
        can be used to produce real-time images of tissue and
        blood motion. However, ultrasound is a low-resolution
        imaging modality that does not produce an image as
        precise and clear as fluoroscopy.

              IMGG's Dominion relies instead on the use of
           fluoroscopy, a high-resolution imaging modality, to
         produce a "live" X-ray image of a living patient in 3D.

                Imaging3 Scheduled to File with the FDA

           Important Milestone Scheduled to Start by Mid-June
                                  2007

        BURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Imaging3(TM), Inc.
        (OTCBB:IMGG - News), developer of a breakthrough
        medical imaging device that produces 3D medical
        diagnostic images of virtually any part of the human
        body in real-time, announced today that it expects to
        file a 510(k) submission with the FDA by June 15th for
        the Dominion(TM) 3D real-time imaging device.

        The FDA 510(k) submission is a device equivalent
        submission comparing the Functionality, Intended Use
        and Energy Transmission with similar devices currently
        on the market. The process can take 6 months or more
        depending upon the complexity of the product and
        quality of the application. "We're extremely excited to
        be ready to file our 510(k) submission with the FDA. We
        hope to obtain FDA approval by year-end, but understand
        the process could continue into 2008. We have generated
        enough data through our initial stages of Beta Testing
        that we are now confident we can proceed with the FDA
        filing," stated Dean Janes, Chairman and CEO.

        Mr. Janes also pointed out that "off-the-shelf"
        components are used, such as the X-Ray source and Image
        Receptor, in the Dominion, and stated further, "While
        it is no guarantee, the fact that we are using 'off-the
        shelf' components known to the FDA, it should help to
        speed the approval process along." Mr. Janes concluded
        his remarks by pointing out that this will be the
        fourth Fluoroscopy based device that he has guided
        through the FDA 510(k) approval process.

<p>Dear Reader,
<p>In a market populated by bold optimism and bright-eyed business plans,
few companies ascend to the lofty precipice of FDA submissions and approvals.&nbsp;
In the small cap world, it seems said optimism and genuine intent are often
the norm with real, marketable successes the aberration.
<p>So, the recent announcement by <b><font color="#000099">Imaging3, Inc.</font>
(OTCBB:IMGG)</b> that it had submitted its innovative Dominion™ real-time
imaging device to the FDA, stands out among many small cap biotechnology
and healthcare stories, all chasing the enormous Baby Boomer-driven market.&nbsp;
While there are no guarantees as to the speed or inclination of an FDA
response, historically responses related to devices are more expeditiously
considered because they typically do not require human trials.
<p>Having advanced to a position of leadership among providers of advanced
medical imaging devices over the past 14 years, <b><font color="#000099">Imaging3</font></b>
is one of the industry’s most respected, long-standing medical device manufacturers,
distributors and third-party service providers. Management indicates that
there are currently <b>no direct competitors </b>in the marketplace providing
the same 3D, real-time, high resolution deliverable.

The <b><font color="#660000">Dominion</font></b> when fully equipped with
CT emulation will sell for approximately $500,000 and the standard Dominion
with real-time 3D imaging will sell in the $200,000 range.&nbsp; The Dominion
with CT capabilities costs about 1/3 the price of a dedicated CT machine
but with the added advantage that it can be used in areas where CT is not
currently available such as the operating and emergency rooms.&nbsp; This
is due to the Dominion’s mobility, small footprint and that it provides
doctors with superior access to the patient than current CT or MRI machines
do.&nbsp; The Dominion does far more and for far less.

<p><b>At this time,</b> the Company's management is not aware of any existing
devices in the marketplace that provide 3D, real-time diagnostic medical
imaging, with the exception of ultrasound. Ultrasound is a real-time tomgraphic
imaging modality. Not only does it produce real-time tomograms of the position
of reflecting surfaces (internal organs and structures), but also it can
be used to produce real-time images of tissue and blood motion. However,
ultrasound is a <u>low-resolution imaging modality</u> that does not produce
an image as precise and clear as fluoroscopy.&nbsp;

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>The
FDA 510(k) submission is a device equivalent submission comparing the Functionality,

of the product and quality of the application. "We're extremely excited
to be ready to file our 510(k) submission with the FDA. We hope to obtain
FDA approval by year-end, but understand the process could continue into
2008. We have generated enough data through our initial stages of Beta
Testing that we are now confident we can proceed with the FDA filing,"
stated Dean Janes, Chairman and CEO.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Mr.
Janes also pointed out that "off-the-shelf" components are used, such as
the X-Ray source and Image Receptor, in the Dominion, and stated further,
"While it is no guarantee, the fact that we are using 'off-the shelf' components
known to the FDA, it should help to speed the approval process along."
Mr. Janes concluded his remarks by pointing out that this will be the fourth
Fluoroscopy based device that he has guided through the FDA 510(k) approval
process.</font></font></font>
