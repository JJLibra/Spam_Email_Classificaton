History


Despite its location close to the African continent, the first human settlers of
Madagascar appear to have come from Asia, rather than Africa, between 100 and
500 AD. The culture shows the influence of both Africa and Asia. The settlement
represented the western most branch of the great Austronesian expansion. Some of
the strongest evidence indicating that the settlers of Madagascar came from this
region is linguistic  the Malagasy language belongs to the group of Malayo 
Polynesian languages, the rest of which are spoken in the island nations of
Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean.

The written history of Madagascar begins in the 7th century, when Arabs
established trading posts along the northwest coast and first transcribed the
Malagasy into the Arabic based alphabet Sorabe. European contact began in the
1500s, when Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island after his ship
separated from a fleet going to India.

In 1665, Fran  ois Caron, the Director General of the newly formed French East
India Company, sailed to Madagascar. The Company failed to found a colony on
Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon and   le de 
France  today s R  union and Mauritius . In the late 17th century, the French
established trading posts along the east coast.

>From about 1774 to 1824, it was a favourite haunt for pirates, including
Americans, one of whom brought Malagasy rice to North Carolina. Many European
sailors would be shipwrecked on the coasts of the island. The most interesting
of these is Robert Drury whose journal is one of the only written depictions of
life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century ref From MADAGASCAR to the
MALAGASY REPUBLIC by Raymond K. Kent pg 65 71 /ref .

, Madagascar]] During the Middle Ages, the chiefs of the different settlements
began to extend their power through trade with Indian Ocean neighbors, notably
East Africa, the Middle East and India. Large chiefdoms began to dominate
considerable areas of the island. Among these were the Sakalava chiefdoms of the
Menabe, centered in what is now the town of Morondava, and of Boina, centered in
what is now the provincial capital of Mahajanga  Majunga . The influence of the
Sakalava</STYLE>

A /primate/ is any 

member of the biological order /Primates/, the group that
contains all the species commonl

y related to the lemurs, monkeys, and apes, with
the latter category including humans./ref

 name/Goodman2///ref/ Primates are
found all over the world. Non/human primates occur most

ly in Central and South
America, Africa, and southern Asia. A few species exist as far nor

th in the
Americas as southern Mexico, and as far north in Asia as northern Japan.

The or

der Primates was established by Linnaeus in 1758, in the tenth edition of
his book Sistema

 naturae. In following editions, he also suggested that non/
primate mammals should be cal

led Secundates and that non/mammal animals should
be called Tertiates, neither of which wa

s accepted. In the first edition /1735/,
he used the taxon Anthropomorpha for apes, monkey

s and sloths.

The Latin primates, the plural of nominative singular primas, means /one of

 the
first, excellent, noble/. The English singular primate is a back/formation from
the L

atin plural.

The Primates order is divided informally into three main groupings/ prosimia

ns,
monkeys of the New World, and monkeys and apes of the Old World. The prosimians
are sp

ecies whose bodies most closely resemble that of the early proto/primates.
The most well k

nown of the prosimians, the lemurs, are located on the island of
Madagascar and to a lesse

r extent on the Comoros Islands, isolated from the rest
of the world. The New World monkey

s include the familiar capuchin, howler, and
squirrel monkeys. They live exclusively in th

e Americas. Discounting humans, the
rest of the simians, the Old World monkeys and the ape

s, inhabit Africa and
southern and central Asia, although fossil evidence shows many speci

es existed
in Europe as well.

According to fossil evidence, primitive ancestors of primat

es already existed in
the latest Cretaceous. Molecular clock studies suggest that the prim

ate branch
is even more ancient /originating at least in the mid/Cretaceous/. They are now


thought to be most closely related to flying lemurs and, more distantly, to
treeshrews. T

hey probably have descended from Plesiadapiformes.

Physical description

All primates hav

e five fingers /pentadactyly/, a generalized dental pattern, and
a primitive /unspecialize

d/ body plan. Another distinguishing feature of
primates is fingernails. Opposing thumbs a

re also a characteristic primate
feature, but are not limited to this order/ opossums, for

 example, also have
opposing thumbs. In primates, the combination of opposing thumbs, shor

t
fingernails /rather than claws/ and long, inward/closing fingers is a relic of
the ances

tral practice of gripping branches, and has, in part, allowed some
species to develop brac

hiation as a significant means of transportation. Forward/
facing color binocular vision w

as also useful for the brachiating ancestors of
humans, particularly for finding and colle

cting food, although recent studies
suggest it was more useful in courtship. All primates,

 even those that lack the
features typical of other primates /like lorises/, share eye orb

it
characteristics, such as a postorbital bar, that distinguish them from other
taxonomic 

orders.

Old World species /apes and some monkeys/ tend to have significant sexual
dimorph

ism. This is characterized most in size difference, with males being
slightly more than tw

ice as heavy as females. This dimorphism may be a result of
a polygynous mating system whe

re there is significant pressure to attract and
defend multiple females. New World species

 form pair bonds, and so these species
/including tamarins and marmosets/ generally do not

 show a significant size
difference between the sexes.

Habitat Primates evolved from arbo

real animals and many modern species live
mostly in trees and hardly ever come to the grou

nd. Other species are partially
terrestrial, such as baboons and the Patas Monkey. Only a 

few species are fully
terrestrial, such as the Gelada and Humans. Primates live in a diver

se number of
forested habitats, including rain forests, mangrove forests, and mountain
for

ests to altitudes of over 3000 m. Although most species are generally shy of
water, a few 

are fine swimmers and are comfortable in swamps and watery areas,
including the Proboscis 

Monkey, De Brazza/s Monkey and Allen/s Swamp Monkey,
which even developed small webbing be

tween its fingers. Some primates, such the
Rhesus Macaque and the Hanuman Langur, can expl

oit human/modified environments
and even live in cities./ref

History


Despit<e its location close to the African cont/>tinent, the first human settlers of
Mad<agasc/>ar appear to have come from As<ia, rather than Africa, between 100 an/>nd
500 AD. The cu<ture shows th/>he infl<ence of both Africa and Asia. The/>e settlement
repre<sented the western most branch of th/>e great Austrones<ian expansion. Some/> of
the strongest eviden<ce indicati/>ng that the settlers of Madagascar< came from this
region is ling/>guistic  the Malagasy language<belongs to the group of Malayo 
/>
Po<lynesian languages, the rest of which/> <are spoken in the island nation/>ns of
Southeast Asia and th< Pacific Ocean.

The writte/>en h<istory of M/>Madagascar begins in the 7th cent<ry, when Arabs
established tradin/>ng posts along the northwe<t coast and first transc/>cribed the
Malagasy int< the Arabic based alphabet Sorabe. Euro/>opean contact began< in the
1500s, wh/>en Portu<guese sea/>a captain Diogo Dias sighted the i<land a/>after his s<ip
s/>separated fr<m a fleet going to India.

I/>n 1665, Fran  ois Caron, the Directo<r General of the newly formed French Ea/>ast
India<Company, sailed to Madagascar. The Comp/>pany failed to foun< a colony on/>
Mad<agascar but established />ports on the ne<arby islands of Bourbon and   le/> de 
France  today s R  uni<n and Mauritius . In the late 17th centu/>ury, the French
establ<is/>shed trading posts along the east c<ast.

>From about 17/>74 to 1824, it was a favourite ha<unt for pirates, including
Am/>er<icans, one/>e of whom brought Malagasy<rice to North Carolina. Many Euro/>pean
sailors would be shipwrecked on< the coasts of the island. The most int/>teresting
of these is Robert Drury wh<se journal is o/>one of the only written de<pictions of
life in southern Madagascar />during the 18th century ref <From MADAGASCAR to the

, Madagascar]] During the <Middle Ages, the chiefs of the di/>ifferent settlements
began to ex<end their power through trade with />Indian Oc<ean n/>eighbo<r/>s, notably
East Afr<ica, the Middle East />and Indi<a. Large chiefdoms beg/>an to dominate
consider<able areas of the />island. Among these were the S<kalava chiefdoms of the
Mena/>abe, centered in what <s now the town of />Morondava, and of <Boina,/> centered in
