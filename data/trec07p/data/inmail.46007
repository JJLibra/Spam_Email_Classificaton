    Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden Powell, 1st Baron Baden Powell  OM, GCMG,
GCVO, KCB  22 February 1857  ndash  8 January 1941 , also known as  B P , was a
lieutenant general in the British Army, writer, and founder of the Scouting
Movement.

After having been educated at Charterhouse School, Baden Powell served in the
British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the
Second Boer War in South Africa, Baden Powell successfully defended the city in
the Siege of Mafeking. Several of his military books, written for military
reconnaissance and scout training in his African years, were also read by boys.
Based on those earlier books, he wrote [[Scouting for Boys]], published in 1908
by Pearson, for youth readership. During writing, he tested his ideas through a
camping trip on Brownsea Island in 1907, which is now seen as the beginning of
Scouting.

After his marriage with Olave St Clair Soames, Baden Powell, his sister Agnes
Baden Powell and notably his wife actively gave guidance to the Scouting
Movement and the Girl Guides Movement. Baden Powell lived his last years in
Nyeri, Kenya, where he died in 1941.

Personal history Early life Baden Powell was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth
Powell, or more familiarly as Stephe Powell, at 9 Stanhope Street, Paddington in
London, England, UK on 22 February 1857. From previous marriages, his father
Reverend Baden Powell  22 August 1796  ndash  11 June 1860 , a Savilian
professor of geometry at Oxford University, already had four adult children. On
10 March 1846 at St Luke s Church, Chelsea, Reverend Powell married Henrietta
Grace Smyth  3 September 1824  ndash  13 October 1914 , and quickly had
Warington  early 1847 , George  late 1847 , Augustus  1849  and Francis  1850 .
After three further children who died when very young, they had Stephe, Agnes
 1858  and Baden  1860 . The three youngest children and the often ill Augustus
were close friends. Reverend Powell died when Stephe was three, and as tribute
to his father, the family name Powell was changed to Baden Powell. Subsequently,
Stephe was raised by his mother, a strong woman who was determined that her
children would succeed. Baden Powell would say of her in 1933  The whole secret
of my getting on lay with my mother.  ref name  jeal    ref  ref

After attending Rose Hill School, Tunbridge Wells, during which his favourite
brother Augustus died, Stephe Baden Powell was awarded a scholarship to
Charterhouse, which is a prestigious public school. His first introduction to
Scouting skills was through stalking and cooking game while avoiding teachers in
the nearby woods, which were strictly out of bounds. He also played the piano
and violin, was an ambidextrous artist, and enjoyed acting. Holidays were spent
on yachting or canoeing expeditions with his brothers. ref name  jeal   

Military career In 1876, R.S.S. Baden Powell, as he styled himself then, joined
the 13th Hussars in India with the rank of Lieutenant. He enhanced and honed his
military scouting skills amidst the Zulu tribesmen in the early 1880s in the
Natal province of South Africa, where his regiment had been posted, and where he
was mentioned in despatches. During one of his travels, he came across a large
string of wooden beads, worn by the Zulu king Dinizulu, which was later
incorporated into the Wood Badge training programme he started after he founded
the Scouting movement. Baden Powell s skills impressed his superiors and he was
Brevetted Major as Military Secretary and senior Aide de camp of the Commander in 
Chief and Governor of Malta, his uncle General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth. ref
name  jeal    He was posted in Malta for three years, also working as
intelligence officer for the Mediterranean for the Director of Military
Intelligence. ref name  jeal    He frequently travelled disguised as a butterfly
collector, incorporating plans of military installations into his drawings of
butterfly wings. ref name  butter</STYLE>
