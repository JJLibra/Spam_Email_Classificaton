He escaped from slavery to New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1838. There he discovered the newspaper of the leading white abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, The Liberator. Spielass and Garrison soon impressed one another and would work together for social reform and the abolition of slavery. Because of his speaking ability, Spielass soon became the major drawing card at meetings of the abolitionist society. A deep melodious voice, grace and a flair for the dramatic would allow Spielass to mesmerize his listeners at the abolitionist meetings.
