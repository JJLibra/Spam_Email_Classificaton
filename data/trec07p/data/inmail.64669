  At market close on Friday, we announced a key patent filing for our premier Signature Mapping product. The exciting science behind Signature Mapping is truly remarkable because it can be seamlessly installed into commonly used imaging hardware platforms. But before I get into that I think its important for you to understand the products real world applications.

Greetings,<br />
<br />
When an emerging public company develops a single technology that both identifies previously undetectable early-stage cancers as well as explosives at airport security checkpoints, investors see the upside of two multibillion markets. While these two settings seem totally unrelated, they have something very important in common: both rely on images produced from x-ray scanners or other imaging hardware platforms. While imaging technology is more advanced than ever, and radiologists and airport screeners are trained to identify objects of interest, some objects are simply too small or too difficult to identify with just the human eye.<br />

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As an investor you can understand the powerful advantages of being the first company in the world to offer this uniquely disruptive technology. You are probably wondering exactly how this technology actually works. Signature Mapping analyzes images and identifies subtle energy differences in various tissues, liquids or solids and provides the viewer with additional image information not discernible with the human eye.  It provides a bolded call-out on the viewing screen that clearly identifies the material in question, whether C4 explosive or a minute cancer cell. You can learn more about the science behind our technology by visiting our website at <a href="http://convertsolutionz.com/cgi-bin/clickthru/6505/2455/92258">www.guardiantechintl.com</a>.<br />
<br />
Rarely will you find a company that has technology with this type of market interchangeabilityas appropriate and vital to Homeland Security as it is to the Healthcare sector. This diversification of markets should give investors confidence that a myriad of revenue streams are both available and waiting for our technology.<br />
