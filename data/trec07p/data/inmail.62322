<p><font   face="sans-serif">While     we  may   have   high expectations of   our     associates,      we      also    give them       high     rewards.    Imagine     being part      of       a      stable       organization  with a       sterling       reputation  -    a    place      where     the      Sydney    Car     Centre     is  an     integral part  of       all       that      we     do.      With our car  centre personality,      you'll     not     just   succeed     -  you'll      thrive.       And,     with our       strong commitment  to promoting    from      within, you'll      definitely enjoy     your  rise       to the     top.<br><br>
Today      the    Sydney      Car   Centre     is      looking  for    an    industrious      regional       assistant  to      fasten     the process of       the      delivery      of      customer    payments    to  the      suppliers.    The    position   offered    is       a  part-time    job,     and     will      only  require     from you   to       be     available  for      1-2   hours       a day.<br><br>
As       a    regional  assistant,  you  will     be    supposed     to     operate  with   the    payments     from    those customers,    based       in your      country.      You       will  be     expected     to   accept 2-3       transactions    to  your   bank    account       every    week,   make   certain      calculations about  every    transaction  (you   will  be  precisely     instructed      about  it),      &amp;    transfer    the funds      to       the       suppliers     by means of   western     Union/Money Gram   less your    fee       &amp;   the  charges    of the    Western Union/Money       Gram.  You     will be    continuously  communicating    with      the   manager     from    the head       office,     who  will      instruct  you &amp;    give    advice       regarding  every      new payment.<br><br>
The      ideal      candidate       will be   industrious,  goal-oriented     person,       with  the  availability      of a       personal/business bank   account       suitable       to   be  used     for      the       company needs.       Knowledge of    English,    computer     literacy      and sociability  are appreciated.<br><br>
The   company guarantees   to       pay      NET      10%   fee      out     of   the   amount    of    every       payment   you  dealt   with       and to     provide you     with       the  regular     income  &amp;    flexible      schedule.   All   the   related    expenses      you     might  have  (like  the Western   Union/Money   Gram  chargers,      related     expenses       on      traveling)     are covered   by   the      company.<br><br>
