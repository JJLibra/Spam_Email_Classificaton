ials have said that since the security crackdown in the Baghdad region began more than 12 we=
eks ago, Sunni insurgents have hit back with powerful, and extremely deadly, car bombs tha=
t often cause more casualties than the types of attacks used previously.

The car bomb attack occurred about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in the village of Abu Saydah in the vola=
tile Diyala province, local police said, giving the casualty toll. The wounded were taken=
 to hospitals in nearby Muqdadiyah and the main Shiite district of Sadr City in Baghdad.

Hospital officials and victims said it appeared chlorine gas was used in the attack as many=
 of the wounded were having difficulty breathing and had their sight affected. But officia=
ls at the provincial police's joint coordination center denied that toxic gas was involve=
d.

One man had a white cloth across his eyes as he lay in his hospital bed; others were bandaged f=
rom head to toe.

Abu Saydah is a mainly Shiite village about 25 miles northeast of the Sunni insurgent stron=
ghold of Baqouba, the capital of the province that has seen a recent spike in violence large=
ly blamed on militants who fled Baghdad ahead of a U.S.-Iraqi security crackdown.
