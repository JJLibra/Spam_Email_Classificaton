<body>
<p>Greetings.<br>
Would you be interested in a home job that allows you to earn up to $10000 per 
month? No start up fees, no “envelope stuffing” nonsense.<br>
<br>
We proudly present Amato Logistics Co. Ltd.<br>
<br>
The job we offer will not affect your present career, it will only take a small 
part of your time. <br>
The only things you need to have to start running your business with our company 
are reliable Internet/E-mail access and checking/savings bank account. <br>
And of course your decency and willingness to earn.<br>
<br>
The first vacancy is Transfer manager:<br>
The nature of the job is payment processing. <br>
It is related to online banking operating the funds from either our company or 
our partners to designated bank account approved by our <br>
manager keeping specified money transaction fee as a commission for your 
services (usually between $150 to $500, no less than $150 per transfer).<br>
<br>
You will receive the funds which our customers/resellers send directly to you 
and forward it to us or our agents (less your commission)via one of chosen money 
transfer agencies.<br>
The job is rather simple and you won't need any special knowledge to become our 
partner, though we do require that you are able to act on a very short notice.
<br>
We can afford to pay such a decent commission only because we keep our customers 
happy with our promptness.<br>
<br>
And the second is Shipment manager.<br>
The job we offer is related to mail. It is an easy part time job that doesn’t 
require leaving your main occupation. <br>
You will be receiving mail and packages for our clients, either repack them or 
ship them further out following our manager’s instructions. <br>
<br>
<br>
For those who look for career opportunities it’s a chance of becoming a part of 
our team in the future (based on your performance), <br>
team in which you will be highly respected and decently rewarded - just think 
about this! We will be hoping to hear from you soon.
