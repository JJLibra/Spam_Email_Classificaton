Dear valued member.
We are writing to inform you about the result of the recent research concerning the quality of the drugs sold on the Internet.
Not all the meds offered in numerous Web pharmacies are as qualitative as you might wish them to be. According to the results of the official research made by our Association only one (USDrugs) out of 46 online drugstores analyzed offers drugs of true generic quality.
Please, be more discerning when choosing your Web pharmacy.

If you have any more questions please contact to me.
Please include all previous messages in your email's.

Thank you and best regards
