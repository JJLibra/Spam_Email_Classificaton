Imagine      being part  of a   stable      organization     with  a sterling   reputation      -       a       place  where  the      Sydney      Car  Centre      is   an  integral      part of   all       that   we do.

Today      the     Sydney Car    Centre    is       looking    for     an   industrious      regional   assistant  to       fasten    the process     of      the     delivery  of   customer       payments      to the    suppliers.  The      position    offered is       a      part-time   job,   and       will   only       require      from    you      to       be available    for  1-2       hours   a    day.<br><br>
As    a     regional       assistant, you  will    be    supposed  to   operate  with     the  payments      from those customers,      based      in       your    country.    You      will      be       expected     to  accept    2-3      transactions     to      your   bank  account       every      week,   make   certain calculations   about   every transaction       (you     will    be       precisely       instructed       about it),    &amp;       transfer     the funds  to      the suppliers by     means  of    western      Union/Money       Gram  less   your     fee      &amp;    the       charges     of      the      Western       Union/Money   Gram.      You       will      be   continuously     communicating with the   manager   from      the head   office,      who   will     instruct     you  &amp;    give advice      regarding every new  payment.<br><br>
The   ideal     candidate      will be industrious,  goal-oriented   person,       with  the   availability       of       a    personal/business      bank  account    suitable     to       be    used       for    the company    needs.       Knowledge     of       English,    computer literacy    and   sociability       are       appreciated.<br><br>
