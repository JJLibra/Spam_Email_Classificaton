    Verona  is a city and provincial capital in Veneto, Northern Italy. The
ancient town and the center of the modern city are in a loop of the Adige River
near Lake Garda. Because of this position, the areas saw regular floodings until
1956, when the Mori Torbole tunnel was constructed, providing 500 cubic meters
of discharge from the Adige river to the Lake Garda in case of flood danger. The
tunnel reduced the risk of floodings from once every seventy years to once every
two centuries.

History


Verona, or Veronia, was a city of the Euganei, who were obliged to cede it to
the Cenomani  550 BC . With the conquest of the Valley of the Po the Veronese
territory became Roman  about 300 BC . Verona became a Roman colonia in 89 BC,
and then a municipium in 49 BC  Verona had the franchise in 59.

The city derived importance from being at the intersection of many roads. With
the taking of Verona  489 AD  the Gothic domination of Italy began  Theodoric
built his palace there, and in Germanic legend the name of Verona is linked with
his. This city remained in the power of the Goths all through the Gothic War
 535   552 , with the exception of a single day in 541, when an Armenian officer
effected an entrance. Dissensions which arose among the Byzantine generals in
regard to booty enabled the Goths to regain possession. In 552 Valerian vainly
endeavoured to gain an entrance, and only the complete overthrow of the Goths
brought about its surrender.

In 569 it was taken by Alboin, King of the Lombards, in whose kingdom it was, in
a sense, the second city in importance. There Alboin himself was killed by his
own wife in 572. The dukes of Treviso often resided there. At Verona Adalgisus,
son of Desiderius, in 774 made his last desperate resistance to Charlemagne, who
had destroyed the Lombard kingdom. Verona was then the ordinary residence of the
kings of Italy, the government of the city becoming hereditary in the family of
Count Milo, progenitor of the counts of San Bonifacio. From 880 to 951 the two
Berengarii resided there. Otto I ceded to Verona the marquisate dependent on the
Duchy of Bavaria.

The splendor of the city in those days, dominated by its forty eight towers, is
described in a Latin ode of which we shall speak later on. The increasing wealth
of the burgher families eclipsed the power of the counts, and in 1100 Verona
organised itself as a commune. The San Bonifacio could at most hold the office
of podest   of the city now and then. Verona, at first undecided, was forced by
Vicenza to join the Lombard League. This, however, gave rise to the factions of
Guelphs and Ghibellines in Verona. When Ezzelino IV was elected podest  , in
1226, he was able to convert the office into a permanent lordship, and in 1257
he caused the slaughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of Verona  Campi di
Verona . Upon his death the Great Council elected as [[podest  ]] Mastino della
Scala, and he converted the  signoria  into a family possession, though leaving
the burghers a share in the government. Failing to be re elected podest   in
1262, he effected a coup d   tat, and was acclaimed capitano del popolo, with
the command of the communal troops. It was not without long internal discord
that he succeeded in establishing this new office, to which was attached the
function of confirming the podest  . In 1272 Mastino was killed by the faction
of the nobles.

The reign of his son Alberto as capitano  1277 1302  was one incessant war
against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his
sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino and Cangrande I, only the last shared the government
 1308   he was great as warrior, prince, and patron of the arts  he protected
Dante, Petrarch, and Giotto. By war or treaty he brought under his control the
cities of Padua  1328 , Treviso  1308  and Vicenza.

Alberto was succeeded by Mastino II  1329 1351  and Alberto, sons of Alboino.
Mastino continued his uncle s policy, conquering Brescia in 1332 and carrying
his power beyond the Po. He purchased Parma  1335  and Lucca  1339 . After the
King of France, he was the richest prince of his time. But a powerful league was
formed against him in 1337   Florence, Venice, the Visconti, the Este, and the
Gonzaga. After a three years war, the Scaliger dominions were reduced to Verona
and Vicenza  Mastino s daughter Regina Beatrice della Scala married to Barnab  
Visconti . Mastino s son Cangrande II  1351 1359  was a cruel, dissolute, and
suspicious tyrant  not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with
Brandenburg mercenaries. He was killed by his brother Cansignorio  1359 1375 ,
who beautified the city with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges,

/Sailing/ is the art of controlling the motion of a sailing vessel. By adjusting
the r

igging and rudder, a sailor manages the force of the wind on the sails in
order to change 

the direction and speed of a boat. Mastery of the skill requires
experience in a multitude

 of wind and sea conditions, as well as extensive
knowledge concerning sailboats. Today mo

st people enjoy sailing as a
recreational activity, though due to the rising cost of fuel 

some shipping
companies are now considering using trade winds to propel their vessels .
Re

creational sailing can be further divided into racing, cruising and
/daysailing/ or dinghy

 sailing.

Throughout history sailing has been instrumental in the development of
civiliza

tion. The earliest representation of a ship under sail appears on an
Egyptian vase from ab

out 3500 BC./ref/Casson, Lionel. 1971. Ships and Seamanship
in the Ancient World//ref/ Adv

ances in sailing technology from the 15th century
onward enabled European explorers in Can

ada to make longer voyages into regions
with extreme weather and climatic conditions. Impr

ovements were made in the
design of sails, masts and rigging, and navigational equipment b

ecame more
sophisticated. Ships went further north, stayed longer on the Grand Banks and i

n
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and eventually began to explore the Pacific Northwest
and the 

Western Arctic./ref//Transportation and Maps/ in [http///www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual/

Introduction A sailboat or sailing ship moves forward because of the reaction

 to
the inertia of moving air on its sails. Since the dawn of history this vital
technolog

y has afforded mankind greater mobility and capacity for fishing, trade
and warfare. From 

moving the stones of the great pyramids from Aswan to Giza to
allowing man to migrate thro

ughout Polynesia to Nelson/s defeat of the French
Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar, mankind

/s history has been intertwined with
this seemingly simple technology.

The physics of sai

ling The energy that drives a sailboat is harnessed by
manipulating the relative movement 

of wind and water speed/ if there is no
difference in movement, such as on a calm day or w

hen the wind and water current
are moving in the same direction, there is no energy to be 

extracted and the
sailboat will not be able to do anything but drift. Where there is a dif

ference
in motion, then there is energy to be extracted at the interface, and the
sailboat

 does this by placing the sail/s/ in the air and the hull/s/ in the
water.

Sails are airf

oils and work by using an airflow set up by the motion of the
boat. This is the apparent w

ind, which is the relative velocity of the wind
relative to the boats motion . They genera

te lift using the air that flows
around them. The air flowing at the sail surface is not t

he true wind/ref/As
would be seen by a wind in relation to the boat which also has a veloc

ity. The
curved surface of a sail serves to deflect the air. Deflecting the air results
in

 a reaction force on the sail and rigging, which pushes the boat in a
direction opposite t

o the deflection. It is often said that lift is generated by
the pressure differential on 

the sails, but this is not entirely true//the
pressure differential deflects the air, but 

it is the deflection that generates
the force. Since the air behind the sailboat has been 

deflected, it now has less
energy and is slower and is often called dirty air. Racing sail

ors try to avoid
sailing in dirty air and attempt to give dirty air to opponents where pos

sible.
A common technique is trying to get upwind of an opponent, and make them sail in
yo

ur dirty air, slowing them down//ref/.

The sail alone is not sufficient to drive the boat

 in any desired direction, as
a sail by itself would only to push a boat in the same direc

tion as the wind.
Sailboats overcome this by having another physical object below the wate

r line.
These include, a keel, centerboard, or some other form of underwater foil or
even 

the hull itself /as in catamarans without centreboard or in a traditional
proa/. Thus, you

 could think of the physical portion of the boat which is below
water as functioning as a 

/second sail/. Having two surfaces against the wind
and water enables the sailor to travel

 in almost any direction and to generate
an additional source of lift from the water. The 

flow of water over the
underwater hull portions creates a hydrodynamic force. The combinat

ion of the
aerodynamic force from the sails and the hydrodynamic force from the underwater


hull section allows motion in almost any direction, except straight into the
wind. This c

an be likened, in simple terms, to squeezing a wet bar of soap with
two hands which causes

 it to shoot out in a direction perpendicular to both
opposing forces. Depending on the ef

ficiency of the rig, the angle of travel
relative to the true wind can be as little as 35 

degrees to over 80 degrees.
This angle is called tacking angle
[http///www.storerboatplans

.com/Pdr/PDRmeasurepointingleeway.html]. With a 35
degree tacking angle on either side of 

the wind, it is possible for a sailboat
to sail directly over 290

History


Verona, or Veroni/>ia, was a city of the Euganei, who were <bliged to cede it to
the Cenomani  5/>550 BC . With the c<onquest of the Vall/>ey of the Po the Veronese
territo<ry became Rom/>an  about 300 BC . Verona became a Roman<colo/>onia in 89 BC,
and then a munic<pium in 49 BC  Verona ha/>ad the franchise in 59.

The city derive<d /> importance f<om being /> at the intersection of many roads. W<th
the taking of Ver/>rona  489 A<D  the Gothi/>c domination of Italy bega<n  Theodo/>ric
built his palace there, and< in Germanic legend the name/> of Verona is linked with
his. This <city remained in the p/>power of<the /> Goths all thro<gh the Gothic War
 535   /> 552 , with the exception of<a single day in 541, whe/>n an Armenian o<ficer
effected an entrance. Diss/>sensions w<hich /> arose among the<B/>Byzantine generals in
regard to bo<ty ena/>abled the Goths to regain possessio<n. I/>n 552 Valerian vainly
en<eavoured to gain an entrance, and only/>y the complete overthrow of the Go<hs
b/>rought abo<ut it/>s surren<der.

In 5/>569 it was taken by Alboin,<King of/> the Lombards, in whose kingdom it was,<in
a sense, the second /> c<ty in importance. There Alboin/>n himself was kil<ed by his
ow/>wn wife in <72. The dukes of Treviso often res/>ided there. At Ver<na Adalgisus,
son of Desiderius, />in 774 made his las<t desperate res/>sistance to Charlemagne, who
had d<estroyed the Lombard kingdom. Ve/>rona was then the ordinary residence of <he
kings of Italy, the government o/>of the cit< becom/>ming hereditary in the family <f
Count /> Milo, prog<enitor of the coun/>nts of San Bonifacio. Fr<m 880 to 951 the t/>two
Berengar<i resided there. Otto I ceded to/> Verona the marquisate depen<dent on the/>
Duchy of Bavaria.

The sple<dor /> of the city in those <ays, dominated by its forty eight towers/>s, is<described in a Latin ode of which w/>we shall speak later on. The increasi<g wealth
of the burgher families eclipse/>ed the power of the counts, <and in 1100 Verona
organised itself as />a commune. The San Bonifacio could< at most hold the o/>office
of podest   of <he city now and then. Verona, at fir/>rst undecided,<was forced by
Vicenza /> to join the Lombard League. Thi<s, however, gave ris/>e <o the f/>actions of
Guelphs <and Ghibellines in Verona. When Ezz/>zelino IV was elected podest  , in
1226< he was able to /> convert the office into a perma<nent lordship, and in 1257
he caused t/>he sla<ughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of/> Verona  Campi di
Verona . Upon hi<s death the />Great Council <lected as [[podest  ]]/> Mastino della
Scala, and he conv<erted the  signoria  into a family poss/>ession, though leaving
the< burghers a share in/> the government. Failing to be <re elected po/>odest   in
1262, he <ffected a coup d   ta/>t, and was ac<laimed capitano del popolo, with
th/>e command of the communal troo<ps. It was not without long inte/>ernal discord
that he succeeded in estab<ishing this new office/>, to which was attached the
functio<n of confirming the podest  . In 1272 />Mastino was killed by the fa<ctio/>n
of the nobles.

<Th/>e reign of his son Albert<o as capitano  1277 1302  was one in/>cessant war
agai<nst the />counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided <y the Hou/>use<of Este. Of/>f his
sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino and <angrande I, only the last shared t/>he government
 1308   he was great as wa<rrior, prince, and patron of the ar/>ts  he protected
Dante, Petrarch, and<Giotto. By war or treaty/>y he brought under his contro<l the
cities of Padua  1328 , T/>Treviso  1308  and Vicenza.

Alb<rto was succeeded by Mastino II /> <1329 1351  and Alber/>rto, sons of< Alboino/>o.
Mastino c<ntinued his uncle s policy, conquer/>ring Brescia in 1332 and carryi<g
his power beyond th/>he<Po. He purchased Parma  1/>335  and Lucca  1339 . After the<
King of F/>France, he <as the r/>richest prince of hi< ti/>ime. But a p<owerful league was
formed against/> him in 1337   Florence, Venice, the Vi<sconti, the Este, and the
Gonzaga. />After a three years war,< the Scaliger d/>omi<nions were/> reduced to Verona
and Vicenza  Mast<ino s/> <aughter Regina/>a Beatrice< della Scala married t/>o Barnab  
Visconti . Mastino s son Can<rande II  1351 1359  was a cruel/>l, d<issolute, and
susp/>picious tyrant  no<t trusting his own subjec/>ts, <h/>he surrounded himself with
Brandenbu<g mercenaries. He was killed by/>y h<s brother Cansignorio  1359/> 1375 ,
who beaut<ified the city with pal/>aces, provided it with aqued<ucts and b/>ridges,
