Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.




Erectile dysfunction (ED), 


sometimes referred 


to as impotence, is the inability 
for a sexually active male to obtain 



and sustain an erection for sexual purposes. In the past, this has been 


very embarrassing for
 men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 

and, in fact, there has been very
 little diagnostic testing or treatment

 options available 
until very recently.
