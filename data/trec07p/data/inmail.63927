<P><FONT face=3D"Courier New" color=3Dblack size=3D2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had any messages today?&nbsp; Now, I don't mean on y=
our phone or email or written notes slipped under your door.&nbsp; I'm talki=
ng about those &quot;messages&quot; that the Universe has for us that are al=
l around, if only we took the time to pay attention to them.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're up on your weather lore, you know that =
nature has many kinds of signs that have been observed throughout the ages t=
hat are messages about a change in the weather.&nbsp; Many old sayings like =
&quot;red sky at night, sailor's delight; red sky in the morning, sailor tak=
e warning&quot; or &quot;clear moon, frost soon&quot; have been found to be =
true indicators of changes in air pressure, humidity, or wind that affect we=
ather conditions.&nbsp; The behavior of animals and insects can also be indi=
cations of changes in the weather.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But besides weather indications, the natural worl=
d can be a source of personal messages from the Universe just waiting for yo=
u to pick up, Memo.&nbsp; Here's a little exercise to help you &quot;tune in=
.&quot;&nbsp; You don't need to live in the countryside to do this; any smal=
l park or other natural setting will do.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose a place outdoors where you can feel privat=
e and safe.&nbsp; Stand still or sit down, if you choose, close your eyes an=
d take a moment to relax and clear your mind (taking a few deep breaths in a=
nd out will help).&nbsp; If you have a particular question or an issue that'=
s been bothering you, bring it to mind now.&nbsp; Or you could simply reques=
t some general guidance.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes and note the first thing that come=
s to your attention.  It could be the first thing you see, or a sound, or a =
scent.  Make a note of what it is, and ask yourself what it reminds you of, =
or what it makes you think of.  Use your instincts about its significance fo=
r you, because this is your own personal message.
