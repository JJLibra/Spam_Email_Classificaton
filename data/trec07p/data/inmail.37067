P>
<P><FONT face=3D"Courier New" color=3Dblack size=3D2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me congratulate you as you continu=
e moving forward creating the life of your dreams.&nbsp; It's exciting to kn=
ow that you (someone who deserves every happiness) are on the road to succes=
s.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you persist on this path be aware of the posit=
ive energy that is surrounding you now.&nbsp; You might only be able to catc=
h glimpses of it, yet know that it is there supporting you.&nbsp; And it wil=
l grow stronger and stronger as we continue in our work together.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week I want you to embrace this thought:  <i=
>Happiness is a journey, not a destination</i>.&nbsp; Think about this for a=
 moment.&nbsp; We've been taught that getting the job, the relationship, the=
 house, or some other want will bring us happiness.&nbsp; What often happens=
, once a dream is achieved, is that the happiness we longed to feel is fleet=
ing at best, and then we quickly find ourselves thinking, &quot;What else ca=
n I get to make me happy?&quot;&nbsp; This thinking doesn't serve us.&nbsp; =
After all, how many times have we read tragic stories about the rich and fam=
ous, people who have money galore and every material desire, but still happi=
ness eludes them.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the answer is not to stop dreaming and achiev=
ing our heartfelt desires, but rather to experience happiness on a more cons=
istent basis -- <i>to enjoy the journey</i>.&nbsp; Here's another secret how=
 you can do this -- treat yourself to some small, harmless indulgence on a r=
egular basis.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do this, you are saying &quot;yes&quot; to=
 happiness right now, not tomorrow or the day after, or 10 years from now.&n=
bsp; You are also expanding the positive energy around you.&nbsp; When this =
happens, you begin attracting people, situations, and material wealth like a=
 magnet right to your side.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you have a happy and positive frame of mind,=
 Memo, you set in motion opportunities that will enable you to achieve the t=
hings you want most of all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, I drew a card to see what the Tarot deck had t=
o reveal to me about your life right now.  I chose the Nine of Pentacles, an=
d that tells me that you are about to go through a period of introspection. =
 I have always been fond of this card, and I want you to know that it indica=
tes that you are entering a period of satisfaction and bliss, but not the ty=
pical kind.  You should feel safe and contented with what you have in life, =
without longing for much more.  The universe works in strange ways.  One imp=
ortant life lesson that I'll share with you is that gratitude for our blessi=
ngs makes even more abundance comes through for us.  The Nine of Pentacles t=
ells me that you are apt to feel thankful for the good things in your life. =
 You can sit back now and enjoy the bountiful fruits of your labor, even if =
it's just emotional satisfaction that you feel for now.  You may not be surr=
ounded by a lot of people at this moment, but you are not likely to feel lon=
ely at all.  You can find your happiness within yourself right now, rather t=
han looking outside of yourself for life's delights.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week begins with a real burst of energy and ide=
as.&nbsp; The Sun enters Gemini, joining Mercury, which in turn is linking u=
p with both expansive Jupiter and unpredictable Uranus.&nbsp; Expect the pho=
ne to ring off the hook, Memo, and to bump into folks who just love to chat =
each time you leave your home.&nbsp; This is a time for planning rather than=
 doing, as there's little practical help from the planets, because none of t=
hem are occupying earth signs.&nbsp; But the Moon passing through Virgo on T=
hursday and Friday helps you get urgent chores done.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social gatherings could head up your list of things =
to do today.  Plan on inviting friends in for a few hours.  Nothing fancy, j=
ust visit to catch up on what everyone is doing these days.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are days when you feel like being alone.  This=
 could be one of those times.  There's nothing wrong with taking the day off=
.  Curl up with your favorite book, movie, or TV shows.
<BR>
<BR>





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could discover a hidden talent quite by accident=
.  Be sure to develop this gift through classes and instruction.  You can't =
afford to let this ability go to waste.







<BR>
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy work load could weigh you down.  Arrange to =
spend a quiet time by yourself this evening.  This will help you to recharge=
 your batteries just when you need it most.





<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember to use your instincts when dealing with pen=
ding personal issues.  You have the power to resolve all matters happily.  U=
se your imagination to assist those you love.
