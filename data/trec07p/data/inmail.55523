Dear ,

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by
virtue if its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though
I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive
and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this
transaction, as we have been reliably informed of your discreteness and
ability in transactions of this nature.

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am Mr.  Mathew
Okon a Branch Accountant with the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos. I came
to know of you in my private search for a reliable and Reputable person to
handle this confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

THE PROPOSITION:

A foreigner, Late Engineer T. Brown an Oil Merchant/Contractor with the
Federal Government of Nigeria, until his death on Friday the 26th of
December 2003 in a ghastly plane crash in Cotonou, Benin Republic, I have
being his personal Accountant Adviser and he Banked with us here at Union
Bank Plc, Head Quarters in Lagos, and had a closing balance of US$13.5M
(Thirteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which the
Bank now unquestionably expects it to be claimed by any available foreign
next-of-kin of the Late beneficiary or alternatively be donated to a
discredited trust fund for arms and Ammunition at a Military war college
here in Nigeria, do confirm the incident on the website:
http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/

Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch
with any of the Brown’s family or relatives but proved no avail. It is
because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of
Late Engr. T. Brown next-of-kin (he had no known wife and children) that
the management under the influence of our chairman and member of the Board
of Directors, retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an arrangement be
made for the funds to be declared "UNCLAIMABLE" and subsequently be
donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and Ammunition to further enhance the
course of war in Africa and the world in general.

In order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted colleagues
and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next-of-kin to Late
Engr. T. Brown so that the funds US$13.5M would be released and paid into
your Bank Account as the beneficiary/next-of-kin. All documents that
proves and will enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out and
more so we are assuring you of a 100% risk free involvement.

Your share stays while the rest would be for my colleagues and myself for
Investment purposes in your country. We have agreed that, the funds will
be shared thus, after it has been transferred into your account 30% of the
money will go to you for acting as the Beneficiary of the funds.

10% will be set aside for reimbursement to both parties for any incidental
expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transfer, 60% to us the
originators of the transaction.

If this proposal is acceptable by you and you do not wish to take undue
advantage of the trust, we hope to bestow on you and your company; then
kindly get back to me immediately via my private Email:
mathew_okonubn@outgun.com  or Call My Tel: 234-803-442-2909  for security
reason.

Furnishing me with your most confidential telephone, fax number and
exclusive Bank particulars/information so that I can use this information
to apply for the release and subsequent transfer of these funds in your
favor.

Yours faithfully,
Mr.  Mathew Okon
