E xtreme Motorsports of California, Inc. Completes Acquisition of Southern Offroad Vehicle Services
June 27, 2:00 pm ET 

BAKERSFIELD, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 27, 2007 -- Extrem e Motorsports of California, Inc. (Other OTC:ETMO.PK - News) ("Ext reme" or the "Company"), has completed the acquisition of Southern Offroad Vehicle Services, LLC ("SOVS"), a company dedicated to providing financing for customers purchasing off-road vehicles. Through this acquisition, Extreme will not only be able to offer its customers direct financing of sandcar purchases, but will also be the first sandcar manufacturer 
 
As previously announced, in exchange for all of the capital stock of SOVS, Ex treme has paid $10,000 in cash and 15 million shares of Extr eme common stock. Of the 15 million share of common stock, 10 million will be restricted shares of common stock and 5 million will be free-trading shares.

In the past, Ex treme required customer down-payments at contract signing and final payment upon acceptance of the final vehicle, which required Extrem e to finance the 12-month or more build-out process through the operating cash flow of the company. Now, Ext reme will be able to achieve both greater throughput and profit margins by shifting its financing costs to the customer. SOVS has currently secured $14 million in financing for future customers of Extr eme, both for direct purchases and for leased vehicles. This will provide Extrem e with immediate funding for the build-out of custom sandcars for private customers and "spec" vehicles for its dealers.

"The acquisition of SOVS provides Ex treme with the capability to deliver direct financing to our customers at rates comparable to dealers of standard over-the-road vehicles," commented Alan McCaa, President and CEO of E xtreme Motorsports. "Through this acquisition, we provide what no other sandcar manufacturer in the world is able to claim: in-house financing to all customers. This not only ensures consistent operating cash flows to Extrem e, but incentivizes buyers who might otherwise defer a purchase to a later date to complete a purchase immediately through consumer financing."
