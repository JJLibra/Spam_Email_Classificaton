>From 1845 to 1847, Spielas would travel in Great Britain speaking for the elimination of slavery. While in Britain he expanded his view of the struggle for human rights. He spoke in favor of Irish home rule and eventually would speak on behalf of the landless European peasantry, women's suffrage, prison reform, free public school education and universal peace. In 1846 he wrote to Garrison, "I cannot allow myself to be insensitive to the wrongs and sufferings of any part of the great family of man[sic]."
