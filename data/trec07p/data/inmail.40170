 George Canning   11 April 1770   8 August 1827  was a British statesman and
politician who served as Foreign Secretary and, briefly, Prime Minister.

Early life Canning was born between 8 and 9 in the morning at his parents  home
in Queen Anne Street, Marylebone, London. His father, George Canning Sr. of
Garvagh, County Londonderry was a gentleman of limited means, a failed wine
merchant and lawyer, who renounced his right to inherit the family estate in
exchange for payment of his substantial debts. George Sr. eventually abandoned
the family and died in poverty on 11 April 1771, his son s first birthday, in
London. Canning s mother, Mary Ann Costello, took work as a stage actress, a
profession not considered respectable at the time.

Because Canning showed unusual intelligence and promise at an early age, family
friends persuaded his uncle, London merchant Stratford Canning  father to the
diplomat Stratford Canning , to become his nephew s guardian. George Canning
grew up with his cousins at the home of his uncle, who provided him with an
income and an education. Stratford Canning s financial support allowed the young
Canning to study at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford.

While at school, Canning gained renown for his skill in writing and debate. He
struck up friendships with Lord Liverpool, Granville Leveson Gower, and John
Hookham Frere. Canning began practising Law after receiving his BA from Oxford
in the summer of 1791. Yet he wished to enter politics.

Entry into politics , London]]

Stratford Canning was a Whig and would introduce his nephew in the 1780s to
prominent Whigs such as Charles James Fox, Edmund Burke, and Richard Brinsley
Sheridan. George Canning s friendship with Sheridan would last for the remainder
of Sheridan s life.

George Canning s impoverished background and limited financial resources,
however, made unlikely a bright political future in a Whig party whose political
ranks were led mostly by members of the wealthy landed aristocracy in league
with the newly rich industrialist classes. Regardless, along with Whigs such as
Burke, Canning himself would become considerably more conservative in the early
1790s after witnessing the excessive radicalism of the French Revolution.

So when Canning decided to enter politics he sought and received the patronage
of the leader of the  Tory  group, William Pitt the Younger. In 1793, thanks to
the help of Pitt, Canning became a Member of Parliament for Newtown on the Isle
of Wight, a rotten borough. In 1796, he changed seats to a different rotten
borough, Wendover in Buckinghamshire.

Political style Canning rose quickly in British politics as an effective orator
and writer. His speeches in Parliament as well as his essays gave the followers
of Pitt a rhetorical power they had previously lacked. Canning s skills saw him
gain leverage within the Pittite faction that allowed him influence over its
policies along with repeated promotions in the Cabinet. Over time, Canning
became a prominent public speaker as well, and was one of the first politicians
to campaign heavily in the country.

As a result of his charisma and promise, Canning early on drew to himself a
circle of supporters who would become known as the Canningites. Conversely
though, Canning had a reputation as a divisive man who alienated many.

Elevation to office On November 2, 1795, Canning received his first ministerial
post  Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In this post he proved a
strong supporter of Pitt, often taking his side in disputes with the Foreign
Secretary Lord Grenville. He resigned this post on 1 April 1799.

In 1799 Canning became a commissioner of the Board of Control, followed by
Paymaster of the Forces in 1800. When Pitt resigned in 1801, Canning loyally
followed him into opposition and again returned to office in 1804 with Pitt,
becoming Treasurer of the Navy.

Canning left office with the death of Pitt but was appointed Foreign Secretary
in the new government of the Duke of Portland the following year. Given key
responsibilities for the country s diplomacy in the Napoleonic Wars, he was
responsible for planning the outmanoeuvering of Napoleon Bonaparte at
Copenhagen.

Duel with Castlereagh In 1809 Canning entered into a series of disputes within
the government that were to become famous. He argued with the Secretary of State
for War and the Colonies, Lord Castlereagh, over the deployment of troops that
Canning had promised would be sent to Portugal but which Castlereagh sent to the
Netherlands. The government became increasingly paralysed in disputes between
the two men. Portland was in deteriorating health and gave no lead, until
Canning threatened resignation unless Castlereagh was removed and replaced by
Lord Wellesley. Portland secretly agreed to make this change when it would be
possible.

Castlereagh discovered the deal in Septemb</STYLE>

<STYLE>]] , Helsinki]] /P//tanque/ is a form of boules where the goal is to throw metalballs as c

lose as possible to a small wooden ball called a cochonnet /jack/. The
game is normally pl

ayed on hard dirt or gravel, but can also be played on grass
or other surfaces. Sandy beac

hes are not suitable. Similar games are bocce and
bowls.

P//tanque is generally associate

d with southern France, particularly Provence,
whence it originates. It is the most played

 sport in Marseille. The casual form
of the game of P//tanque is played by about 17 millio

n people in France /mostly
during their summer vacations/. There are about 375,000 players

 licensed with
the F//d//ration Fran//aise de P//tanque et Jeu Proven//al /FFPJP/. The FFP

JP is
the 4th/largest sporting federation in France. These licensed players play a
more co

mpetitive form of P//tanque known as P//tanque Sport.

History P//tanque is reputed to hav

e been invented in 1907 in the village of La
Ciotat near Marseille as a less physically/de

manding form of [[jeu proven//al]].
Physical effort was reduced by shortening the length o

f the pitch by roughly
half and replacing a moving delivery with a stationary one. The nam

e is derived
from the term pieds tanqu//s, which in the Marseilles dialect of French means


/stuck feet/, because in P//tanque the feet have to remain fixed together within
a /small

/ circle. It is of interest that this also means that handicapped people
in wheelchairs ca

n compete without any disadvantage. P//tanque has become so
popular that the term Jeu de B

oules /game of balls/ is often used to refer to
it, even though P//tanque is only one of s

everal variants of boules. Many French
villages have a special stadium for the game called

 a Boulodrome.

The international P//tanque federation [http///www.boulepetanque.se/int/fi

pjp/
F//d//ration Internationale de P//tanque et Jeu Proven//al] was founded in 1958
in Ma

rseille and has about 600,000 members in 52 countries /2002/.

The first World Championshi

ps were organized in 1959. The most recent
championships were held in Faro, Portugal /2000

/, Monaco /2001/, Grenoble
/2002/, Geneva /2003/, Grenoble /2004/, Brussels /2005/, and Gr

enoble will host
2006. Fifty/three countries participated in 2004 and the number is growin

g every
year.

Rules The game is always played in teams. In competitions there are three
d

ifferent configurations/

/ three players per team /two boules per player/, called pairs
/

 two players per team /three boules per player/, called doublets
/ one player per team /th

ree boules per player/, called singles

The boules are made of metal and weigh between 650

 g and 800 g, with a diameter
of between 71 mm and 80 mm. The jack is made of wood or synt

hetic material and
has a diameter of between 25 mm and 35 mm.

The playing area should be 

at least 15 meters /49 ft/ long, by 4 meters /13 ft/
wide.

A player from the team that wi

ns the toss starts the game by drawing a circle on
the playing field /35 to 50 cm in diame

ter/. Both feet must be inside this
circle, touching the ground, when playing. The player 

then throws the jack to a
distance of between 6 and 10 metres from the starting circle. Th

e jack must be
visible and at least 1 metre from any obstacle or boundary, otherwise it mu

st be
thrown again.

A player from the team that wins the toss then plays the first boule,

 trying to
place it as close to the jack as possible. Then the opposing team must get
clos

er to the jack and keeps playing until they succeed. When they do, it is
back to the first

 team to do better, and so forth.

A player may choose to /place/ a boule /get it as near 

as possible to the jack/
or /shoot/ it /attempt to displace another boule/. When one team 

runs out of
boules the other team plays their remaining boules. When all boules have been


played, that is the end of a /round/, and the winning team scores a point for
each boule t

hat is nearer to the jack than the opposing team/s nearest boule.

Displacing the jack wit

h a boule is allowed. It is an advantageous /albeit
dangerous/ play for a skilled player l

ate in a round, when all or most members
of his team have played long.

The team that wins

 a round starts the next one, and a new circle is drawn where
the jack ended up in the pre

vious round.

If a boule completely crosses any of the predetermined boundaries, it is
con

sidered dead and cannot be scored. Likewise, if the jack is moved and
subsequently complet

ely crosses a boundary, the round is scratched and the jack
is thrown again. If only one t

eam has boules remaining to throw when this
occurs, they receive points for every unplayed

 ball. Accordingly, the /extremely
difficult/ play of deliberately shooting out the jack i

s a winning gambit in
some circumstances. /Points for boules in hand/ is not, in fact, par

t of the
official rules of the game but is usually played anyway.

A complete game is usua

lly played up to 13 points.

Strategy A successful p//tanque team has players who are skil

led at shooting as
well as players who only point. For obvious reasons, the pointer or poi

nters
play first // the shooter or shooters are held in reserve in case the opponents
plac

e well. In placing, a boule in front of the jack has much higher value than
one at the sam

e distance behind the jack, because intentional or accidental
pushing of a front boule gen

erally improves its position. At every play after
the very first boule has been placed, th

e team whose turn it is must decide
whether to point or shoot. Factors that count in that 

decision include/

 <Geo/>orge Canning   11 April 1770   8 Aug<st 1827  was a Brit/>tish statesma<n and
politician />who <served as Foreign Secretary and, briefl/>y, Prime Mi<nister.

Early life Canning was />born b<etween 8 and 9 in/> the morning at his pa<ents  home
in Queen Anne S/>Street, Marylebone, Lo<don. His father, George Canning Sr. of/>f
Garvagh, County Londonderry was <a gentleman/>n of<limited means, a failed wine
merc/>chant a<d/>d lawyer, who renounced his ri<ht />to inherit the f<amily estate in
exchange for payment o/>of his substantial debts. George S<r/>r. even<tually abandoned
the f/>amily and died in poverty on <1 April 1771, his s/>son s f<rst birthday, in
London. Cannin/>ng s mother, Mary Ann<Costello, took work a/>as a stage a<tress, a
profession not con/>nsider<d respectable at the time.

B/>Because Canning showed unusual in<elligence and promise at an early age/>e, family
friends p<ers/>uaded his uncle, London merchant Stratf<rd Canning  fathe/>r t<o the
diplomat Stratford Cann/>ning <, to bec/>ome his nephew s guardia<n. George Can/>ni<g
grew up with his cou/>usins at the home of his uncle, who <rovided him with an
income/> and an education.< Stratford /> Canning s financial suppor< allowed the young
Cannin/>ng to study a< Eton College and Christ C/>Church, Oxford.

While at s<chool, Cann/>ning< gained renow/>n for his skill in writing and debate. <e
struc/>k u<p friendships with /> Lord Liverpool,<Granville Leveson Gower, a/>nd John
Hookham Frere. Canning beg<a/>an practising Law after receiving hi< BA from Oxford/>d
in the summer of 1791. Yet he wis<he/>ed t<o enter politics.

Entry />into poli<tics , London]]

Str/>atford Canning wa< a Whig and would introduc/>e his nephe< in t/>the 1780s to
promi<nent Whigs such as Charles James Fox/>, Edmund Burke, and Richard Br<ns/>sl<y
Sheridan. Ge/>eorge<Canning s frien/>ndship <with Sher/>idan would <last for the rema/>inder
of Sheridan s life.

George C<anning s imp/>overished back<gro/>und and limited fin<ncial resources,
however, made u/>nlikely <a bright political fu/>uture <in a Whig party whose politica/>al
<anks were led m/>mo<tly by members of the wealthy landed/> aristocracy in leag<ue
with the new/>wly ric<h industrialist classes. Regardless, />along with Whigs such as
Burke, Canning <himself would become considerably m/>more conservative in the early
1790s a<ter witnessin/>ng the <xcessive radicalism of the French Revol/>ution.

So when Canning decided to enter<politics he sought and received the /> patronage
of the leader of the  <ory  group, Will/>liam Pitt the Younger. In 1793, tha<nks to
the/> help of <Pitt, Canning b/>ecame a Member of <Parliament for Newtown o/>n the Isle
of Wight<, a rotten/> borough. In 1796, h<e changed sea/>ts to a different rotten
borough, Wen<over in Buckinghamshire.

Polit/>tical styl< Canning rose quickly i/>in British politic< as an effective ora/>tor
and writer. His speeches in <Parliam/>ent as well as his essays g<ave the followers
/>
of Pitt a rhetorical po<er they had previously lacked. Cannin/>g s skills saw< him
gain leverag/>e within the Pittite faction t<at allowed him i/>influen<e over its
policies /> along wi<th/> repeated promotio<ns/>s in the Cabinet. Over time,<Canning
became a prominent publ/>ic speaker as well, and was one of th<e first poli/>iticia<s
to campaign heavily in the c/>ountry.

As a r<sult of his charisma and promise, Can/>nning <arly on drew to himself a
circle of supp/>port<rs who would become known as the C/>Cann<ngites. Conversely
though/>h, Canning had a r<putation as a divisi/>ive man who alienated many.
<
Elevation to office On November 2, 179/>95, Canning received<his first min/>ni<sterial
post  Under Secretar/>y of State for Foreign Affairs. <n this post />he proved a
strong supporter of Pitt, <often taking />his side in disp<tes /> with <the Foreign
Secretary/> Lord< Grenville. He resigned this post on 1/>1 April 1799.

In 1799 Canning became < commissioner of the Boar/>rd of Control, followed by<Paymaster of/> the Forces in 1800. When<Pitt resigned in 1801, Canning loyally
/>
followed him into opp<osition and again returned to office />in 1804 with Pitt,
<ecoming Treasurer of the Navy.

Ca/>anning left of<ice with the death of Pitt but was a/>ppointe< Foreign/>n Secretary
in <the new government of />the Duke of Portland the following y<ear. Given ke/>y
responsibilities for the c<untry s /> dipl<macy in/> the Napoleoni<c Wars, he was
resp/>ponsible <for planning the/> outmano<uvering of Napoleon /> Bonaparte at
Copenhagen.

Duel w<th Castlereagh In 1809 Canning /> entered into a <series of disputes within/>
the government that wer< to become famous. He argued wi/>ith the Secretary of S<ate
for War and the C/>olonies, Lord Castl<reagh, over the/> deployment of troo<s that
Canning had promised would be se/>nt to <Portugal but which Castler/>eagh sent to the
Neth<erlands. The government became increa/>singly paralysed in d<s/>putes between
the two men. Portland <was in deterioratin/>ng health and gave no lead, until
Can<ing threatened resignat/>tion unless Castle<reagh was removed a/>nd replaced by
Lord Wellesley. P<rtland secretly agreed/> to make this change when it wou<d be
possible.
