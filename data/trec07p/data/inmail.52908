Imagine  being    part     of     a   stable    organization   with a      sterling       reputation       - a      place    where     the  Sydney    Car   Centre is an  integral       part  of all    that we       do.

Today the       Sydney     Car Centre     is looking   for       an    industrious       regional     assistant     to     fasten      the    process       of    the    delivery  of     customer       payments  to  the   suppliers.     The    position   offered     is      a     part-time job,     and    will      only    require     from   you    to be available for   1-2      hours  a   day.<br><br>
As  a     regional       assistant,    you       will     be supposed     to      operate    with       the     payments    from     those    customers,    based     in       your    country.     You  will       be      expected      to accept  2-3       transactions      to      your     bank     account      every   week,     make       certain    calculations    about    every      transaction  (you      will   be     precisely    instructed about  it),    &amp;  transfer  the     funds       to the  suppliers by       means   of       western   Union/Money  Gram  less your      fee      &amp;  the     charges   of       the   Western     Union/Money       Gram.       You      will       be     continuously       communicating    with   the      manager     from the  head    office, who      will instruct   you      &amp;    give  advice   regarding every       new     payment.<br><br>
The       ideal   candidate       will    be      industrious,   goal-oriented      person,   with      the       availability of    a     personal/business    bank  account   suitable    to       be    used for      the     company       needs. Knowledge  of   English,       computer literacy     and      sociability   are     appreciated.<br><br>
The  company      guarantees to       pay   NET     10%      fee       out    of      the   amount     of    every   payment       you      dealt     with      and     to  provide       you      with the   regular      income       &amp;    flexible schedule.   All      the   related      expenses      you  might       have    (like   the   Western    Union/Money       Gram  chargers, related     expenses   on  traveling)  are    covered  by    the     company.<br><br>
