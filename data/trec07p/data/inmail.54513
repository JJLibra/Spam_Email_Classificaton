The  Ferruginous Hawk ,  Buteo regalis , is a large buzzard type hawk and is the
largest hawk species although not considered a True Hawk.

Adults have long broad wings and a broad grey, rusty or white tail. The legs are
feathered to the talons, like the Rough legged Hawk. There are two colour forms 
  Light morph birds are rusty brown on the upper parts and pale on the head,
  neck and underparts with rust on the legs and some rust marking on the
  underwing. The upper wings are grey.
  Dark morph birds are dark brown on both upperparts and underparts with light
  areas on the upper and lower wings.

Their breeding habitat is prairie and open country in mid western North America.
They build a stick nest on top of a tree or cliff edge, sometimes on the ground.
Sometimes, cattle dung is used to line nest  historically, buffalo dung was
used.

In the central part of their range, they are permanent residents. Northern birds
migrate to the southern United States and Mexico.

These birds search for prey while flying over open country or from a perch. They
may also wait in ambush outside the prey s burrow. They mainly eat small or medium 
sized mammals such as jackrabbits and ground squirrels, also snakes and large
insects.

Studies have found that prairie dogs can be a main prey item for Ferruginous
Hawks, linking them to the populations of prairie dog towns in the mid west and
southwestern United States, which have been declining in recent years.

In flight, these birds soar with their wings in a dihedral.  Ferruginous  refers
to the rusty colour of the light morph birds.

This bird s numbers are declining due to loss of habitat. This bird may also be
sensitive to the use of pesticides on farms  they are also frequently shot.

It is often used as a falconry bird.

Description The ferruginous hawk is a large, long winged buteo of the open, arid
grasslands and shrub steppe country of the interior parts of North America.
Although flexible in choosing a nest site and exhibiting a high reproductive
potential, this bird s restriction to natural grasslands on the breeding grounds
and specialized predation on mammals persecuted on rangelands may make
conservation a continuous concern. It is migratory in the northern parts of its
range but can be found year round in the mid and southwest United States. At
times it has been considered threatened, endangered, or of concern on various
threatened species lists but recent population increases in local areas, coupled
with conservation initiatives, have created some optimism about the bird s
future.


This is the largest of the buteos and is often mistaken for an eagle due to its
size, proportions and behavior. As with all raptors the female is larger than
the male, but there is some overlap in the range of measurements for both.
Length measurements range from 20 to 26 inches  51 to 66 cm  with an average of
23 inches  58 cm   wingspans from 48 to 60 inches  122 to 152 cm  with an
average of 56 inches  142 cm   and weights from 2.2 to 4.5 pounds  998 to 2,041
g .

Classification There has recently been an opinion that because of DNA studies
the Ferruginous Hawk should be reclassified as an eagle.

Identification Tips The male and female have identical markings. The main
difference is size, with the female being larger. Perched birds have a white
breast and body with dark legs. The back and wings are a brownish rust color.
The head is white with a dark streak extending behind the eye. The wing tips
almost reach the tip of the tail.

The underside is primarily light colored with the dark legs forming a  V  shape.
