th rockets, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, said Ahmed al-Kaisi, spokesman for t=
he pro-Fatah Presidential Guard, which guards the crossing under an agreement with Israe=
l. =22We consider this a serious provocation and a crime committed in cold blood,=22 al-Ka=
isi said.

When forces from another Fatah security unit raced to the scene to provide backup, they wer=
e ambushed by Hamas gunmen, witnesses said.

A jeep full of security men that came under fire veered off the road and crashed. Hamas force=
s then surrounded the vehicle and riddled it with gunfire, said one witness, who works in a n=
earby factory. =22It was unbelievable. May God help us,=22 said the man, who gave only his f=
irst name, Jamil, out of fear for his safety.

Hospital and security officials said eight men were killed in the ambush. After the incide=
nt, several bodies were seen strewn in the grass near the overturned jeep, as gunmen in pick=
up trucks nearby held machine guns in the air.

As the fighting raged, Israeli troops opened fire at two gunmen who approached the border,=
 the army said. Palestinian officials said one man was killed. He was identified as a member=
 of the Presidential Guard, who apparently was trying to help his comrades against Hamas.

Witnesses also said three Israeli tanks approached Karni, and the Hamas force quickly wit=
hdrew. Israel also closed the crossing, known as Gaza's lifeline because it is the passage=
 for cargo going in and out of the area.
