<p><font      face="sans-serif">While    we may    have high     expectations       of  our     associates, we  also   give     them   high    rewards.  Imagine  being       part       of       a   stable   organization       with a  sterling      reputation      -  a      place where  the  Sydney     Car  Centre is   an     integral part  of   all    that    we    do.     With    our    car   centre   personality,  you'll   not  just    succeed   -       you'll  thrive.  And,  with  our    strong       commitment     to promoting from    within, you'll  definitely   enjoy      your   rise       to       the     top.<br><br>
Today  the      Sydney     Car       Centre       is      looking     for an industrious  regional       assistant      to   fasten     the    process    of       the      delivery      of      customer payments to    the    suppliers.       The    position  offered       is a     part-time       job,   and   will      only   require      from     you     to    be   available for     1-2    hours      a day.<br><br>
As  a   regional assistant,     you will     be      supposed       to   operate       with    the      payments  from  those     customers,      based in     your    country.    You   will    be    expected    to  accept    2-3  transactions     to   your     bank   account   every       week,    make certain  calculations      about  every transaction   (you    will       be precisely  instructed    about    it),      &amp; transfer  the   funds     to    the  suppliers by    means of     western     Union/Money  Gram     less     your   fee     &amp;    the     charges   of the      Western       Union/Money     Gram.     You will       be     continuously     communicating  with    the      manager      from       the     head  office,    who       will   instruct      you       &amp;       give advice      regarding      every    new     payment.<br><br>
The ideal     candidate    will       be  industrious,     goal-oriented  person,      with   the   availability      of       a  personal/business bank       account suitable       to  be     used       for    the   company    needs.      Knowledge      of       English, computer       literacy     and   sociability  are   appreciated.<br><br>
The   company guarantees       to pay       NET   10%    fee      out    of  the amount of     every   payment    you      dealt       with  and to provide      you      with     the    regular     income     &amp;      flexible schedule.  All      the  related      expenses   you       might   have      (like      the     Western  Union/Money   Gram     chargers, related     expenses on     traveling)  are       covered      by      the   company.<br><br>
