<STYLE> Most of this article is about heads of state. For more on other kinds of
presidents, see [[ Non governmental presidents Non Governmental Presidents]],
below. For more on the usage of term  president , see [[President  history of
the term ]]. For the card game, see [[President  game ]]. For presidencies in
colonial India during the British Raj, see [[Presidencies of British India]].


 President  is a title held by many leaders of organizations, companies, trade
unions, universities, and countries. Etymologically, a  president  is one who ,
who sits in leadership  from Latin prae   before  + sedere  to sit   giving the
term [[praeses]] . Originally, the term referred to the presiding officer of a
ceremony or meeting  i.e. chairman   but today it most commonly refers to an
official with executive powers.

Among other things,  president  today is a common title for the head of state of
most republics, whether popularly elected, chosen by the legislature or a
special electoral college. It is also often adopted by dictators.


Presidential symbols Furthermore in some nations the Presidency enjoys certain
symbols of office, such as an official uniform, decorations, a presidential
seal, coat of arms, flag and other visible accessories  military honours such as
gun salutes, Ruffles and flourishes, and a presidential guard. A common
presidential symbol is the presidential sashes worn by Latin American presidents
as a symbol of the presidency s continuity, and presenting the sash to the new
president is a key part of the inauguration ceremony.

Sub national presidents President can also be the title of the chief executive
at a lower administrative level, such as the parish presidents of the parishes
of the U.S. state of Louisiana, the presiding member of city council for
villages in the U.S. state of Illinois, or the municipal presidents of Mexico s
municipalities. Perhaps the best known sub national presidents are the borough
presidents of the Five Boroughs of New York City.

Non governmental presidents President is also used as a title in some non 
governmental organizations.

The head of a university or non profit corporation, particularly in the United
States of America, is often known as president. In university systems with
multiple independent campuses, the relationship between the roles of president
and chancellor can become quite complicated. President is also a title in many
corporations. In some cases the president acts as chief operating officer under
the direction of the chief executive officer.

In British constitutional practice, the chairman of an Executive Council, acting
in such a capacity, is known as a President of the Executive Council. Usually
this person is the Governor but is not always so.

In French legal terminology, the president of a court consisting of multiple
judges is the foremost judge  he chairs the meeting of the court and directs the
debates  and this thus addressed as  Mr President , Monsieur le Pr  sident, or
appropriate feminine forms . In general, a court comprises several chambers,
each with its own president  thus the most senior of these is called the  first
president   as in   the First President of the Court of Cassation is the most
senior judge in France  . Similarly in UK legal practice the most senior judge
in each division uses this title  e.g. President of the Family Division,
President of the Court of Appeal .

Many other organizations, clubs, and committees, both political and non 
political are led by Presidents as well. Examples can vary from the President of
a political party, to the president of a chamber of commerce, to the President
of a students  union and even the president of a high school chess club.

In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, the head of the church is
known as the President. Together with his two counselors, they are known as the
First Presidency. This pattern is repeated throughout the church in quorums and
in other bodies, each of which is led by a president. The Methodist Church in
the UK  and also other provinces  is led by the President of the Methodist
Council, and assumes the role of leading minister and spokesperson.

/Dover/ is a major channel port in the English

 county of Kent. At the 2001
census, the town of Dover proper had a population of 28,156 i

nhabitants, while
the population of the whole urban area of Dover, as calculated by the Of

fice for
National Statistics, was 39,078 inhabitants. /External reference/
[http///www.sta

tistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk/8271/More/Y]/. The
town is the administrative c

entre of the Dover district.

Dover is famous for its white cliffs, which are made of chal

k. The cliffs gave
Britain its nickname of [[Albion]], meaning /white/. The town/s name de

rives
from the Brythonic Dubr//s //the waters//.

Its closeness to continental Europe /nda

sh/ it is only 34 kilometres /21 miles/
from the French port of Calais /ndash/ makes Dover

 one of the United Kingdom/s
busiest cross/Channel ports, with 18 million passengers passi

ng through each
year. Regular ferry services operate from Dover to Calais and Dunkerque. A


regular catamaran service to Boulogne recommenced in May 2004. Catamaran
services provide

d by Hoverspeed to Ostend were withdrawn in 2003, and to Calais
on 7 November 2005. Hovers

peed had previously operated hovercraft services to
and from Calais and Boulogne for many 

years.

Dover is represented in Parliament by the Labour MP Gwyn Prosser.

Since 1836 the 

town of Dover /originally being the two parishes of Dover St.
Mary/s and Dover St. James/ 

has incorporated the ancient villages and parishes
of Buckland and Charlton. These are now

 suburbs of the town.

Most of the western half of the town is in Hougham parish and a sma

ll part of
the eastern section and Dover Castle are in Guston parish

/Maxton/ was once a 

hamlet of Hougham parish to the west of Dover, and the
terminus of the tramway system serv

ing the town until its closure in 1936. It is
now a suburb of the town.

History



As the

 closest point in Britain to France, Dover has been strategically
important, vulnerable to

 invasion and an important port for millennia.

Bronze Age

In 1992, a waterlogged boat wa

s discovered in a depth of 6 m that dates to the
Bronze Age and is one of the oldest seago

ing vessels ever recovered. It has been
dated by the radiocarbon method to ca. 1550 BC.

T

he Langdon Bay hoard, discovered in 1974 off the Dover coast, contains bronze
axes of a Fr

ench type and may represent the cargo of a sunken vessel, thus
demonstrating cross/channel

 trade already for the Bronze Age, if not earlier.
Both this hoard and the boat are on dis

play in a new purpose/built gallery of
the Dover Museum in Market Square.

Roman

In Roman

 times it became an important fortified port, named [[Portus Dubris]].
Dover was the start

ing point of the Watling Street Roman road, and was an
important harbour of the Classis Br

itannica.

In around AD 50 the Romans built two lighthouses, one on either side of the the

n/river/
estuary /now silted/up, one on the Western Heights whose few remains are now
with

in the Drop Redoubt, and the other which still stands to its full height in
the grounds of

 Dover Castle, making it one of the oldest buildings in Britain.
The /Painted House/ is a 

Roman mansio from about AD 200 and one of the best
preserved Roman houses in Britain. On t

he same site and nearby there is also a
Classis Britannica fort and the Saxon Shore Fort w

hich was built over them both.

Anglo/Saxon and Norman, to 1200


After the Battle of Hast

ings in October 1066, William the conqueror /or William
the Bastard as he is known in Kent

/ and his forces marched to Westminster Abbey
for his coronation. They took a roundabout r

oute, via Romney, Dover, Canterbury,
Surrey and Berkshire. From the Cinque Ports/s foundat

ion in 1050, Dover has
always been a chief member / it may also have been this that first 

attracted
William/s attention, and got Kent the motto of Invicta. In the words of William


of Poitiers/ /Then he marched to Dover, which had been reported impregnable and
held by a 

large force. The English, stricken with fear at his approach had
confidence neither in the

ir ramparts nor in the numbers of their troops ...
While the inhabitants were preparing to

 surrender unconditionally, [the
Normans], greedy for booty, set fire to the castle and th

e great part of it was
soon enveloped in flames...[William then paid for the repair and] h

aving taken
possession of the castle, the Duke spent eight days adding new fortifications 

to
it/.

 President  is a title<held by many l/>leaders of organizations, companies, tra<de
unions/>s< uni/>iversities, and countries<. Etymologically, a  president />  is one <ho ,
who sits />in leadership  from Latin prae   b<efore  + sed/>ere < to sit />   giving the
term [[pra<ses]] . Originally, the term referred t/>o the presiding officer of a
ceremony <or meeting  i.e. chairman   but today it/> most commonly refers <to an
offic/>ial with executive po<ers.

Among other thing/>gs,  president  tod<ay is a common title for the h/>ead of state of
most republ<ics, whether popular/>ly elected, chosen by the< legislature or a
s/>special electoral college. It is also o<ften adopted by dictators.


Pr/>esi<en/>tial symbols Furthermore in<some nations the Presidency enjoys /> certain
symbols of office,< such as an official uniform, /> <ecorations, a presidential
seal,/> co<at of arms, fl/>lag and other visible accessor<es  military honours such as
gun salu/>tes, Ruffles and flo<rishes, and a presidential guard. A c/>ommon<
presidential symbol is the presidentia/>al sashes worn by Latin American pres<de/>nts
as a symbol of the <residency s continuit/>ty, and presenting the <ash to the new
pr/>resident is a key part of <he i/>nauguration ceremony.
<
Sub national preside/>ents President can also <e the title o/>of the chief executive
at a lowe<r administrative level,/>, such as the parish pr<sidents of the p/>arishes
of the U.S. state of Louisiana<, th/>e presiding member of< city council /> for
villages in the U.S. state of <llinois,/>, or the<municipal presidents of Mexic/>o s
municipal<ities. Perhaps the best kno/>own sub national preside<ts are the/>e borough
presid<nts of the Fiv/>ve Boroughs of New <ork City.

Non governm/>mental p<residents President i/>s also used <s a title in some /> non 
governmental organiza<tions.

T/>he head <of />a univer<ity or non profit corporation, part/>icularly in the Unite<d
States of America, is often />known as president. <In university systems with
multipl/>e independ<nt campuses, the relationsh/>hip between the roles of <resident
and/> chancellor can become quite complica<ted. Pres/>sident is also<a title in many
/>
corporations. In<some cases the president acts as chie/>ef operating of<ficer under
the direction of the c/>hief executiv< o/>fficer.

In British constituti<onal practice, the chair/>rman of an Executive Council, acti<g
in su/>uch a capacity,<is known as a President of the E/>xecutive Council. Usually
this person< is the Governor but is/>s not <always s/>so.

In French legal<terminology, the president o/>f a court c<nsisting of mu/>ultiple
j<udges is the foremost judge  /> he chairs the meeting of the court and <irects the
d/>ebates  <nd this thus /> addr<ssed as/>  Mr President , Monsieur le Pr  <sident, />or
appropriate feminine forms . In <eneral, a court comprises seve/>eral chambers,
each wit<h its own president  thus the most seni/>or of these is ca<lled the  first
presiden/>nt < as in   the First President of the Cour/>rt of Cassation is the mos<t
senior judge in France  . Similarly/>y in UK legal practice the <ost senior judge
in each division /> uses thi< title  e.g. President of t/>the Family Division,
Presi<ent of the Court of Appeal .

Many o/>other organizations, clubs, and commit<tees, both political and non 
political />are l<ed by Presidents as well. /> Examples ca< vary from the President of
a politi/>ical party< to the president of a chamber of /> c<mmerce, to the President
of a stu/>udents  union and even the preside<t of a high school chess club.

In /> The Church of Jesus C<rist of Latter day/>y Saints, the head of the church is
kno<n/> as the <President. Together with his two coun/>nselors, they are k<own as the
First/>t Presi<ency. This patter/>n is repeated throughout the< church in quorums and
in other/>r bodies, each of which<is led by a president. The/> Methodist Chu<r/>ch in
the U<K  and also other provinces  is />led by the President of the Methodist
Co<ncil, and assum/>mes <he role of leading minister and spokes/>sperson.
