 [[Media Nl Leiden.ogg Leiden]]   in English also  ndash  though now rarely
 ndash   Leyden   is a city and municipality in the province of South Holland in
the Netherlands. It forms a single urban area with Oegstgeest, Leiderdorp,
Voorschoten, Valkenburg, Rijnsburg and Katwijk, with 254,000 inhabitants. It is
located on the Old Rhine, close to the cities of The Hague and Haarlem.

Its geographical coordinates are  in decimals  52.16N, 4.49E . RD coordinates
 94, 464 .

A university town since 1575, Leiden houses   The Leiden University  The Leiden
University Medical Centre  A campus of Webster University

History Although it is true that Leiden is an old city, its claimed connection
with Roman Lugdunum Batavorum is spurious  Roman Lugdunum is actually the modern
town of Katwijk, whereas the Roman settlement near modern Leiden was called
Matilo. However, there was a Roman fortress in Leiden in the 4th century.

Leiden formed on an artificial hill at the confluence of the rivers Oude and
Nieuwe Rijn  Old and New Rhine . In the oldest reference to this, from circa
860, the settlement was called Leithon. The landlord of Leiden, situated in a
stronghold on the hill, was initially subject to the Bishop of Utrecht but
around 1100 the burgraves became subject to the county of Holland. This county
got its name in 1101 from a domain near the stronghold  Holtland or Holland.

Leiden was sacked in 1047 by Emperor Henry III. Early 13th century, Ada,
Countess of Holland took refuge here when she was fighting in a civil war
against her uncle, William I, Count of Holland. He besieged the stronghold and
captured Ada.

Leiden received city rights in 1266. In 1389, its population had grown to about
4000 persons.

Siege of 1420 In 1420, during the Hook and Cod wars, Duke John of Bavaria along
with his army marched from Gouda in the direction of Leiden in order to conquer
the city. The army was well equipped and had some guns. Burgrave Filips of
Wassenaar and the other local Hoekse noblemen assumed that the duke would
besiege Leiden first and send small units out to conquer the surrounding
citadels. But John of Bavaria chose to attack the citadels first with his army.
By firing at the walls and gates the troops could weaken the citadels one by
one. Within a week John of Bavaria conquered the castles of Poelgeest, Ter Does,
Hoichmade, de Zijl, ter Waerd, Warmond and de Paddenpoel.

On June 24 the army appeared before the walls of Leiden. On August 17, 1420,
after a two month siege the city surrendered itself to John of Bavaria. The
citadel earl Filips of Wassenaar was stripped of his offices and rights and
lived out his last years in captivity.

16th and 17th centuries

Leiden flourished in the 16th and 17th century. At the close of the 15th century
the weaving establishments  mainly broadcloth  of Leiden were very important,
and after the expulsion of the Spaniards Leiden cloth, Leiden baize and Leiden
camlet were familiar terms. In the same period, Leiden developed an important
printing and publishing industry. The influential printer Christoffel Plantijn
lived there at one time. One of his pupils was Lodewijk Elzevir  1547 1617 , who
established the largest bookshop and printing works in Leiden, a business
continued by his decendants.

In 1572, the city sided with the Dutch revolt against Spanish rule and played an
important role in the Eighty Years  War. Besieged from May until October 1574 by
the Spanish, Leiden was relieved by the cutting of the dikes, thus enabling
ships to carry provisions to the inhabitants of the flooded town. As a reward
for the heroic defence of the previous year, the University of Leiden was
founded by William I of Orange in 1575. Yearly on October 3, the end of the
siege is still celebrated in Leiden. Tradition tells that the citizens were
offered the choice between a university and a certain exemption from taxes.

Leiden is also known as one of the places where some of the Pilgrims  as well as
some of the first settlers of New Amsterdam  [http //www.newyorkfamilyhistory.o 
rg/modules.php?name Sections op printpage artid 40]
[http //pages.prodigy.net/parrish/MapGroundZero.html] lived for a time in the
early 17th century before their departure to the New World
[http //www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1999/2/1999_2_102.shtml].

In the 17th century, Leiden prospered, in part because of the impetus to the
textile industry by refugees from Flanders. While the city had lost about a

/Some Like It Hot/ is a 1959 comedy film directed b

y Billy Wilder. It stars
Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, and Jack Lemmon, and the supporting 

cast includes
Joe E. Brown and George Raft. In 2000, the American Film Institute listed So

me
Like It Hot as the funniest American film of all time.

The movie was adapted by Billy 

Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond from the story by
Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan. Logan had al

ready written the story /but
without the gangsters/ for a German movie, Fanfaren der Liebe

 /directed by Kurt
Hoffmann, 1951/, so that Wilder/s film is seen by some as a remake.

Pl

ot

Some Like It Hot tells the story of two struggling musicians, Joe and Jerry
/Curtis an

d Lemmon/, who are on the run from a Chicago gang after witnessing the
Saint Valentine/s D

ay massacre of 1929. Spats Columbo /Raft/, the gangster in
charge, orders the execution of

 Jerry and Joe. They escape in the confusion and
decide to leave town. But the only out/of

/town job they can find is in an all/
girl band, so they disguise themselves as women and 

call themselves Josephine
and Geraldine /later he changes it to Daphne/. They join the ban

d and go to
Florida by train. Joe and Jerry both fall for /Sugar Kane/ Kowalczyk /Monroe/,


the band/s Polish/American vocalist and ukulele player, and fight for her
affection while

 maintaining their disguises.

In Florida, Joe woos Sugar by assuming a second disguise as

 a millionaire
/claiming to be /Junior/, the heir to Shell Oil, and mimicking Cary Grant/s


voice/, while an actual millionaire, Osgood Fielding III /Brown/, falls for
Jerry in his 

Daphne guise. One night Osgood asks out to his yacht. Joe convinces
Jerry/Daphne that he c

ould keep Osgood ashore while he goes on his yacht with
Sugar. That night Osgood proposes 

to Daphne and Daphne, in a state of confusion,
accepts. The mob eventually finds Joe and J

erry again, when they arrive at the
same hotel for a conference honoring /Friends of Itali

an Opera/. After several
humorous chases /and witnessing yet another mob rubout/, Jerry, J

oe, Sugar, and
Osgood escape to the millionaire/s yacht. Then Sugar tells Joe she/s in lov

e
with him, not Junior. Jerry tells Osgood he is a man and Osgood utters the
immortal line

 /Oh well. Nobody/s perfect./

Trivia

/It was said that Tony Curtis/s voice was dubbed wh

en pretending to be Josephine
since he wasn/t able to get his voice to fit a woman/s voice

.

/On the set, Wilder grew exasperated by Monroe/s inability to remember her
lines. He ha

d several of them written in inconspicuous spots on the set, so she
could read them. It is

 possible to see Monroe/s eyes move back and forth during
the scene where she talks to Cur

tis/ character on the phone in her hotel room /
she was reading from a chalkboard held beh

ind the camera.

/Monroe was pregnant during the film/s production and had a miscarriage t

he day
after its first audience preview. Her pregnancy is most noticeable in the famous
ya

cht scene.


/Jack Lemmon considered a scene from this film to be the best of his screen
c

areer. Tony Curtis enters the hotel room to find Lemmon lying on a bed clothed
in an eveni

ng dress, singing and shaking a pair of maracas. Lemmon announces
he/s engaged to Joe E. B

rown. After blithely answering a string of objections /
What will you do on your honeymoon

? morphs into a comparison of the French
Riviera and Niagara Falls / Lemmon admits that he

 plans to annul the marriage
and collect alimony as hush money.

/Wilder paid tribute to t

hree great gangster movies of the 1930s with subtle
gags in the movie/s script. The crimel

ord /Little Bonaparte/ stems from [[Little
Caesar]], while Spats Columbo threatens to smas

h a grapefruit in the face of one
of his henchmen /James Cagney/s famous scene from [[The 

Public Enemy]]/. He then
grabs a coin from the air as it is being flipped by another gangs

ter, a clich//
that originated with Raft/s character in Howard Hawks/ [[Scarface /1932
mov

ie//Scarface]] ////// thus making Raft/s line /Where did you pick up that
cheap trick?/ a 

bit of meta/humor.

/The film was originally planned to be filmed in full color, but after

 several
screen tests it had to be changed to black and white. The reason for this was a
v

ery obvious /green tint/ around the heavy make/up of Tony Curtis and Jack
Lemmon when in r

ole as Josephine and Daphne.

/Scenes were filmed at the Hotel del Coronado in Coronado, C

alifornia.

/The film/s title is a line in the nursery rhyme /Pease Porridge Hot./ It also


occurs as dialogue in the movie when Joe, as /Junior/, tells Sugar he prefers
classical m

usic over hot jazz.

/The film/s working title was /Not Tonight, Josephine/.

Histor/>y Although it is tru<e that Leiden is an old city, its claim/>m<ed conn/>ection
with Roma< /> Lugdunum Batavorum is<spurious  Roman Lugd/>unum is actually <the modern
to/>wn of Katwij<, whereas the Roman settlemen/>t near modern Leiden was called
M<atilo. However, there was/>s a Roman fortress in Leiden <n the 4th century.

Leiden formed o/>n an artificial< hill at/> the confluence of the rivers Oud<e a/>nd
Nieuwe Ri<n  Old and New R/>hine . In the ol<dest reference to this, from circa
8/>60, the <settlement was called Leith/>hon. The landlord of Leiden, s<tuated in a
stronghold on the hi/>ill, wa< initially subje/>ct to the Bishop of <trecht but
around 1100 the burgrav/>ve< became subject to the county of /> Holland. T<his county
got its name in />1101 from a d<main near the stronghol/>d  Holtl<and or Holland.

Leiden was s/>acked in 1047 by Emperor Henry III<. Ear/>rly 13th century, Ada,
Co<untess of Holland took refuge here w/>hen she wa<s fighting in a/> civil war<against /> her uncle, William<I, Count of Holland. He besieged th/>e <stronghold and
cap/>tured Ada.

Leiden received city rights <in 1266. In 1389, its population /> had gro<n to a/>bout
4000 persons.

Sie<ge of 1420 In 1420, during th/>e Hook and Cod wars, Duke Jo<hn of Bavaria along
with his />army< mar/>rched from Gouda< in the direction of/> Leiden in order <o conquer/>r
the city. <he army was well e/>equipped and had some guns. Burgrave Fi<ips of
Wass/>enaar and the other local Hoekse nob<lemen assumed that the duke />would
besi<ege Leiden firs/>t and send <small/>l units out to conq<uer th/>e surrounding
citadels. But Jo<hn of Bavaria chose to />attack the citadels first <ith his army.
By firin/>g at the walls and gates the troop< could weaken/>n the citadels one by
one. Within a we<ek John of Bavaria conquered the />castles of Poelgeest, Ter Does,
Hoic<hmade, de Zijl,/>, ter Waerd, Warmon<d and de Paddenpoel.

On June/> 24 the army appeared befor<e the walls of Leiden. On August/> 17, 1420,
after a two month<s/>siege the city surrendered itself to Jo<n of Bavaria./>. The
citadel <earl Filips of Wassenaar was stripped />of his offices and rights and
li<ed out his las/>st years in captivity.

16th and 17th ce<nturies

Leiden flour/>ished in the 16th and 17th centur<y. At the close of the 15th />century
the weaving establishm<nts  mainly broadcloth  of Leid/>en were very important,
and aft<er the expulsion of the Spaniard/>ds Leiden cl<t/>h< Leiden baize a/>and Leiden
camlet were familiar terms<./> In the same period, Leid<n developed an important
prin/>nti<ng />and publishing industry. The infl<ential printer Christoffel Plantijn
l/>lived there at one time. One of his p<pils was Lodewijk />Elz<vi/>ir  1547 1617 , who
e<stablished the largest book/>shop and printing works in Leiden,< /> a business
co<ntinued by h/>his dec<ndants.

In 1572, the city sided /> w<ith the D/>utch revolt against Spanish rul<e and played an
important role in th/>e Eighty Years  War. Besieged from May< until October 1574 by/>y
the Spanish, Leid<n was relieved by the cutting/>g of the dikes, thus enabling
ships <o carry provisions to the in/>nhabitants of the flooded town. As < reward
for the heroic d/>defence of the previo<s /> year,<the University of Leiden was/>s
founded by William I of<Orange in 1575. Yearly on October 3,/>, the end of the
siege is sti<l celebrated in Leid/>den. Tradition tells t<at the ci/>tizens were
offered the choice <between a univ/>ersity and a certain exemption< from taxes.
/>
Leiden is al<so known as one o/>of the places where some of the Pilgrim<s  as well as
s/>ome of the first settlers <of New Amsterdam /> [http //www.newyorkfamilyhistory.o

In the<17th century, Leiden prospered,/>, in p<rt/>t because of the impetus to the
texti<le ind/>dustry by refuge<s from Flan/>ders. W<ile the city had lost about a
