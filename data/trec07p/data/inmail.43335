 Rhodes University  is a university in South Africa.

The university is situated in Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape Province of South
Africa. The town is famous for its numerous churches as well as its hosting of
the National Arts Festival, which takes place annually in the early days of
July. Rhodes is home to over 5,000 students, about 3,000 of whom live in
residences on campus. The remaining students rent out flats or live in their own
homes in the town. The university boasts six main faculties   commerce,
education, humanities, law, pharmacy and science   and over 30 different
academic departments.

History Rhodes owes its unique character among South African universities to a
combination of factors   historical, geographical, cultural and architectural.
Its history is a chronicle of the people whose intellect, vision and courage
created and sustained a university, often against seemingly insuperable odds.
Successive generations of Rhodians, imbued with their independence of thought,
have had an influence on southern Africa and world affairs out of all proportion
to their small numbers.

In the beginning University education in the Eastern Cape began in the college
departments of four schools  St Andrew s College, Grahamstown  Gill College,
Somerset East  Graaff Reinet College  and the Grey Institute in Port Elizabeth.
By the turn of the century only St Andrew s and Gill still prepared candidates
for the degree examinations of the University of the Cape of Good Hope.
Limitations in staff, laboratory equipment and libraries made tuition
inadequate. It was obvious that only a central university college could provide
a satisfactory standard of university education.

Grahamstown, out of the mainstream of commercial and industrial life, seemed an
unlikely choice for a university city, but local residents were strongly in
favour of the idea. The chief obstacle was lack of funds. The South African War
of 1899 1902 almost extinguished the project.

In December 1902 Josiah Slater, Member of Parliament for Albany and editor of
the Graham s Town Journal, called a meeting to try to rekindle public interest.
He succeeded beyond all expectations, but enthusiastic promises of local and
financial support were not enough. The newly formed committee applied,
unsuccessfully, to the Rhodes Trustees for the financial backing they needed.

Selmar Schonland, distinguished botanist and curator of Albany Museum, then
tried a direct approach to one of the Rhodes Trustees, Dr. Leander Starr
Jameson.

Jameson, soon to be elected Member of Parliament for Albany and Prime Minister
of the Cape Colony, promised   50,000 without consulting his fellow Trustees. At
first they refused to confirm the grant  then, persuaded by Schonland, they made
over De Beers Preference Shares to the value of   50,000 to Rhodes University
College, founded by Act of Parliament on May 31, 1904.

The early years The four St Andrew s College professors, Arthur Matthews, George
Cory, Stanley Kidd and GF Dingemans became founding professors of the Rhodes
University College and Matthew s outstanding survey class provided the nucleus
of the Rhodes student body. The new university college prepared its students for
the examinations of the University of the Cape of Good Hope.

At the beginning of 1905, Rhodes moved from cramped quarters at St Andrew s to
the Drostdy building, which it bought from the British Government. During 1905
seven new professors, including Schonland, joined the original four. One of the
distinctive features which evolved early in Rhodes  history was the tutorial
system, adapted from the Oxbridge model. Each student was assigned to a staff
member who took a personal interest in his or her work and welfare. As numbers
increased, students were assigned tutors and tutorial groups within academic
departments, providing a forum for the lively debate characteristic of a Rhodes
education.

Expansion The foundations of the Rhodes residential system were founded within a
decade. Steadily growing student numbers put pressure on available accommodation
in school hostels and  approved boarding houses  as well as class and laboratory
space in the motley collection of military buildings housing the college.

At this point, Baker and Kendall, the firm started by an architect of growing
reputation, Herbert Baker, offered their services to the Council to draw plans
for a new Rhodes. Their design won the competition held by the Council in 1910.
Within five years a new Chemistry Zoology block and the first residences for men
and women, College and Oriel, were built to Baker and Kendall plans.

Moves by the South African College in Cape Town and the Victoria College in
Stellenbosch to become autonomous universities began as early as 1905. The
Rhodes Senate and Council quickly realised that an independent Cape Town
University might threaten the still precarious existence of Rhodes. Fears were
only allayed when Rhodes became a constituent college of the new University of
South Africa in 1918.

By 1917 Rhodes  finances had ebbed to the point where staff retrenchment became
unavoidable. However, expansion was essential for survival. Increased postwar
subsidies, a government bond on all Rhodes property and further help from the
Rhodes Trustees made possible the construction of the firs</STYLE>

Geography Tennessee lies adjacent to eight other states/ Kentucky and Virginia
to the nor

th/ North Carolina to the east/ Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi on
the south/ and Arkansa

s and Missouri on the Mississippi River to the west.
Tennessee ties Missouri as the states

 bordering the most other states. The state
is trisected by the Tennessee River. The highe

st point in the state is the peak
of Clingmans Dome at 6,643 feet /2,025/nbsp/m/,/ref name

/usgs// which lies on
Tennessee/s eastern border, and is the highest point on the Appalach

ian Trail.
The lowest point is the Mississippi River at the Mississippi state line. The
ge

ographical center of the state is located in Murfreesboro on Old Lascassas
Pike /just down

 the road from Middle Tennessee State University/ and is marked
by a roadside monument.

T

he state of Tennessee is geographically and constitutionally divided into three
Grand Divi

sions/ East Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, and West Tennessee.

Tennessee features six princ

ipal physiographic regions/ the Blue Ridge, the
Appalachian Ridge and Valley Region, the C

umberland Plateau, the Highland Rim,
the Nashville Basin, and the Gulf Coastal Plain.

See

 also/ [[List of Tennessee counties]]

East Tennessee

The Blue Ridge area lies on the eas

tern edge of Tennessee, bordering North
Carolina. This region of Tennessee is characterize

d by high mountains, including
the Great Smoky Mountains, the Chilhowee Mountains, the Uni

coi Range, and the
Iron Mountains range. The average elevation of the Blue Ridge area is 5

,000 feet
/1,500 m/ above sea level. Clingman/s Dome is located in this region.

Stretchin

g west from the Blue Ridge for approximately 55 miles /88/nbsp/km/ is
the Ridge and Valley

 region, in which numerous tributaries join to form the
Tennessee River in the Tennessee V

alley. This area of Tennessee is covered by
fertile valleys separated by wooded ridges, su

ch as Bays Mountain and Clinch
Mountain. The western section of the Tennessee valley, wher

e the depressions
become broader and the ridges become lower, is called the Great Valley.



Middle Tennessee To the west of East Tennessee lies the Cumberland Plateau. This
area is 

covered with flat/topped mountains separated by sharp valleys. The
elevation of the Cumber

land Plateau ranges from 1,500 to 1,800 feet /450 to
550/nbsp/m/ above sea level.

To the 

west of the Cumberland Plateau is the Highland Rim, an elevated plain
that surrounds the N

ashville Basin. The northern section of the Highland Rim,
known for its high tobacco produ

ction, is sometimes called the Pennyroyal
Plateau and is located in primarily in Southwest

ern Kentucky. The Nashville
Basin is characterized by rich, fertile farm country and high 

natural wildlife
diversity.

Many biologists study the area/s salamander species because t

he diversity is
greater there than anywhere else in the U.S. This is thought to be because

 of
the clean Appalachian foothill springs that abound in the area. Some of the last

U<iversity College/>e and Ma<tthew s outst/>an<ding survey class provided the n/>nucleus
of the Rhodes studen< body. The new university college/> prepared i<ts students for
the examinations of the />Universi<ty of the Cape of G/>Good Hope.

At t<e beginning of 1905, Rhodes moved fr/>rom cramped quar<ters at St Andrew s t/>o
the Drostdy building, which it bou<ht from the British Governme/>nt. During 1905
seven new <professors, including Schonland, joined /> the origi<nal four. One of the
distin/>cti<e features/>s which evolved early in Rhodes  histo<y/>y was the tutorial
system, adapted fr<om the Oxbridge model. Each/>h student was assigned to a <taff
/>
member w<o took a personal inte/>erest in his or her work and <welfare. As numbers
increased, stud/>ents were assigned tutors and t<utorial g/>roups within academic
departments, prov<ding a forum for the lively debate cha/>aracteristic of a Rh<odes
education.

Expansion The fou/>ndation<s of the Rhodes reside/>ntial system were founded within a
dec<de. Steadily growing student nu/>umbers put pres<ure o/>on available ac<ommodation
in scho/>ol hostels and  approved boar<ing houses  as well as class and/> laboratory
sp<ace in the motley collection of mil/>itary buildings housi<ng the college.

At this point, Baker/> and Kendall, the firm sta<ted by an ar/>rchitect of growing<
reputation,/> Herbert Baker, offered their services t<o t/>he Council t<o draw plans
f/>or a new Rhodes. Their d<sign won the competition held b/>y the Council in 1910.
Within five y<ars a new Chemistry Zoology block a/>and the first residence<s for men
and women, Colleg/>e and Oriel, were built to Baker and<Kendal/>l plans.

Moves by the South A<frican College/> in Cape Town and the< Victoria College in
Ste/>llenb<osch to become aut/>onomous< universities began as early as 190/>5. The
Rhodes Senate and Council quickly< realised that an/> independent Cape Town
Univer<sity />might threate<n the still precarious existenc/>ce of Rhodes. Fears were
onl< allayed when Rhodes became />a const<tuent college of the new University of
S/>South Africa in 1918.

By 1917 Rhod<es  finances had ebbed to the po/>int where staff retrenchment became<
unavoidable. However, expansion/> was essential for survival. Incre<sed postwar
subsidi/>es,<a government bond on all Rh/>hodes property and further<help/>p from the
