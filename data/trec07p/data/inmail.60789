 Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin   Russian               
                                          ,  Michel Bakunin  on the grave in
Bern ,  May 18  30 N.S. , 1814  ndash  June 19  July 1 N.S. , 1876  was a well 
known Russian revolutionary, and often considered one of the    fathers of
modern anarchism . Born in the Russian Empire to a family of Russian nobles,
Bakunin spent his youth as a Junior Officer in the Russian army but resigned his
commission in 1835. He went to school in Moscow to study philosophy and began to
frequent radical circles where he was greatly influenced by Alexander Herzen.
Bakunin left Russia in 1842 for Dresden, and eventually Paris where he met
George Sand, Pierre Joseph Proudhon and Karl Marx. He was ordered back to Russia
in 1844 by Emperor Nicholas I, but he refused. As a result, his noble status was
revoked and he was sentenced, in absentia, to hard labor in Siberia. He was
eventually deported from France for speaking against Russia s oppression of
Poland. In 1849 he was apprehended in Dresden for his participation in the Czech
rebellion of 1848. He was turned over to Russia where he was imprisoned in Peter 
Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg. He remained there until 1857, when he was
exiled to a work camp in Siberia.

He was able to escape via Japan and the USA, and ended up in London for a short
time where he worked with Alexander Herzen on the radical journal, The Bell. He
ultimately left in 1863 to join the insurrection in Poland. He, however, failed
to reach his destination and spent some time in Switzerland and Italy. Despite
his criminal status, Bakunin gained great influence with radical youth in
Russia, and all of Europe. In 1870, Bakunin was involved in the insurrection in
Lyon, which foreshadowed the Paris Commune. In 1868, Bakunin joined the
International Working Men s Association, also known as the First Internationale,
a federation of radical and trade union organizations with sections in most
European countries. The 1872 Congress was dominated by a fight between a faction
around Marx who argued for participation in parliamentary elections and a
faction around Bakunin who opposed such participation. The faction around
Bakunin lost the vote on this issue but at the end of the congress Bakunin and
several others of that faction were expelled for supposedly maintaining a secret
organisation within the international. The anarchists insisted the congress was
rigged and so held their own conference of the International at Saint Imer in
Switzerland in 1872. Bakunin continued to be very active in this and the
European socialist movement. In the years between 1870 and 1876 he wrote much of
his seminal work such as Statism and Anarchy and God and the State. Despite his
declining health he attempted to take part in an insurrection in Bologna, but
was forced to return to Switzerland in disguise and settled in Lugano. Bakunin
remained active in the Radical movement of Europe for many years, until further
health problems cause him to be moved to a hospital in Berne, Switzerland where
he died in 1876.

Biography Early years In the spring of 1814, Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin was
born to an aristocratic family in the village of Pryamukhino
                     between Torzhok                and Kuvshinovo
                    , in Tver guberniya, northwest of Moscow. At the age of 14
he left for St. Petersburg, receiving military training at the Artillery
University. He completed his studies in 1832, and in 1834 was commissioned a
junior officer in the Russian Imperial Guard and sent to Minsk and Gardinas in
Lithuania  now Belarus . That summer, Bakunin became embroiled in a family row,
taking his sister   s side in rebellion to an unhappy marriage. Though his
father wished him to continue in either the military or the civil service,
Bakunin abandoned both in 1835, and made his way to Moscow, hoping to study
philosophy.

Interest in Philosophy In Moscow, Bakunin soon became friends with a group of
former university students, and engaged in the systematic study of Idealist
philosophy, grouped around the poet Nikolay Stankevich,    the bold pioneer who
