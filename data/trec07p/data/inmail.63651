SREA Acquires $75 Million Dollar Asset!

Score One Inc.(SREA)
$0.30

News hit just after close. SREA has acquired the $75 Million peace of
land for the new "Recreation Town" in Dalian. This new project mimics a
Facility in "Shui On" that profited more than $100 Million USD. SREA is
going to go through the roof after this hits investors this weekend. Get
on SREA at open on Monday!

A plain-text e-mail with a link to a site that actually had what I
wanted would have been irritating. Probably not, since Mr. My guess
would be Outlook Express. Zeldman opts to receive plain text mail and
knowingly uses a mail client whose HTML mail capabilities are
contemptible.

The same idea can work for designers. Allowing them to customize certain
aspects of your site is very simple skinning. It can screw up a website,
or in this case give some people a good laugh. Advice for Beginners:
Learn the Class Libraries Do you have any advice for those just learning
to program in the Java language?
When the images ARE the content then they are paramount to design. I get
all my email as plain text.

Promote awesomely hip HTML email with sweet images of all the products
Nokia needs to pimp. It salves guilt complexes and incites
passive-aggressive avoidance behaviors.
What is the solution? But what this user actually cares about is message
management.
Search: A List Apart Happy Cog  Hosted by Media Temple. My guess would
be Outlook Express. Rely on the fact that most people get enough
corporate junk to count it as spam rather than hold the sender
accountable.

Say email one day does support precise control over design via
standards.

Since I have link underlining turned off, I see no links. I went last
year, but I sure wanted to double my pleasure this year.

This ties into another item I ran across today, from the always relevant
Jeffrey Zeldman. We can simply provide them with an extension mechanism.
It is totally readable! If you take a class out of context, it will be
compiled differently than it will in your application, which means
performance must be measured under realistic conditions.

Yet unsolicited mail, as all internet users know, makes it hard to use
e-mail to communicate with friends, family, and work mates. Because
those users are perceived to represent a tiny, dare I say it, disposable
fraction of the audience. Only the background color between and
surrounding content elements is up to the user.
Too Much XML Four years ago, you also said that the overuse of XML was a
significant performance problem for Java developers.

The Java language is not just a syntax: There's a design philosophy that
goes with managed languages. Your reach has proven to be vast and
multidisciplinary indeed.

Even people who seem to care about design make it. Whenever I install a
browser on any computer, I always set the default background color to
gray.

Man, I go green with envy. Man, I go green with envy. So what do they
suggest? Clearly the layout must work correctly in some applications;
doubtless, too, there must be some users who enjoy getting craploads of
musician photos in their e-mail in-box.

Suprised to see yahoo is not with the program.
Experienced Java programmers would do well to learn what's new with each
version of the platform, because each version contains library
enhancements that can make their job easier.
