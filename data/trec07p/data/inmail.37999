 was behind Saturday's attack.

=22It's difficult to verify anything that al-Qaida in Iraq would say because they lie,=
=22 said Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, a military spokesman. However, =22it would not surp=
rise us if it were al-Qaida behind this, because we've seen this type of attack, this type of=
 tactic, before.=22

Insurgents also launched attacks across the country Sunday, with a suicide bomber in nort=
hern Iraq slamming a truck into local offices of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which is h=
eaded by Massoud Barzani, leader of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.

Cars were charred and crushed by the blast in Makhmur, a town with a substantial Kurdish pop=
ulation just south of the autonomous Kurdish-controlled areas.

At least 50 people were killed and 115 were wounded, including the city's mayor, Abdul Rahm=
an Delaf, who also is a prominent Kurdish writer, and the director of the KDP office, said Zi=
ryan Othman, the health minister of the Kurdish regional government.

=22Makhmur is an open, peaceful area, and al-Qaida is trying to destabilize it by causing f=
ighting between Arabs and Kurds,=22 said Qassim Amin, who son and daughter =E2=80=94 who b=
oth work for the party =E2=80=94 were injured.=20
