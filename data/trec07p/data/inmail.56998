To celebrate the 28th anniversary program,The Action Aid International
in conjunction with the Economic Community for West African States
(ECOWAS), United Nations Organization (UNO) and the European Union (EU)
is giving out a yearly donation of US$500, 000.00 (Five Hundred

worldwide; in different categories for their personal business

strategy.
The objective is to make a notable change in the standard of living of

and all around).The Action Aid International has been assured of

belief that we can achieve a great positive change in the general

everything possible to get all recipients notified of their donation.
Note that your country is not the only country that is benefiting from
this donation. Beneficiaries have been chosen from countries from all
continents. The idea of this donation is that within ten years from
now,
there will be notable richness among many unusual people around the
world. This will give many people the opportunity to get their lives to
a stage where they had always wanted.
Kindly note that you will only be chosen to receive the donation once,
which means that subsequent yearly donation will not get to you again.
Take time and thought in spending the donation wisely on something that
will last you a long time. Recipients are only eligible to be awarded
this donation once.
Based on the random selection exercise of internet websites and
millions of supermarket cash invoices worldwide, you were selected
among the lucky recipients to receive the award sum of US$500,000.00
(Five
Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) as charity donations/aid from The

a

cash invoice around your area in which you might have purchased
something from).

All information is strictly confidential and will only be used for the
purpose to which it is been requested.
Please note that these donations/Grants are strictly administered by
Economic community for West African States (ECOWAS), European Union
(EU),
under delegated powers from the United Nations Organization (UNO). This
means that your qualification number will be raffled to know the
organisation (ECOWAS or EU) that will handle your payment. You are to
keep
this whole information confidential until you have been able to collect
your donation, as there have been many cases of double and unqualified
claim, due to beneficiaries informing third parties about his/her
donation.
Finally, all funds should be claimed by their respective beneficiaries,
no later than 15 days after notification. Failure to do so will mean
cancellation of that beneficiary and its donation will then be reserved
for next year's recipients.
On behalf of the Board kindly, accept our warmest congratulations.
Regards.
Mrs. Claudio Gandoni
(Foundation Officer)
