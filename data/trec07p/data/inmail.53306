        Dear Reader,

        The only thing better than a growth market is a growth
        market inside a growth market.  That could certainly
        describe the opportunity before i-level Media Group
        (OTCBB: ILVL), an emerging media company delivering
        powerful digital media solutions for out-of-home
        advertising (“OA”) in the People’s Republic of China
        (“PRC”).  The company is focused on an underdeveloped
        market niche with enormous potential - Digital media
        advertising in taxis..  With thousands of its LCD
        advertising screens installed in taxis across China
        already, i-level appears to be at the forefront of a
        huge opportunity.

        Moreover, the company announced an agreement today that
        will give ILVL exclusive access to 3,200 additional
        taxis in Beijing.  This entry into China's capital city
        marks a major milestone for i-level as Beijing is
        critical to the success of i-level's national mobile
        media network strategy. This contract along with others
        the company has previously put in place positions
        i-level for continued rapid growth.  With a potential
        market of over 60,000 taxis currently in service in
        Beijing and the 2008 Olympics just around the corner,
        Beijing is an ideal market for ILVL.(See Breaking NEWS

                            Shanghai in taxis

        These individuals are eager to become integrated in the
        global economy and to enjoy the living standards of
        developed nations. This in turn has been a catalyst for

        goods and higher-end products and services.
        Consequently, producers of such goods and services are
        clamoring for effective media to reach this emerging
        middle class and tap into its fast-growing buying
        power. i-level meets this need by providing an
        innovative and exciting medium that effectively targets
        these individuals.

        i-level is well positioned for rapid expansion with
        870,000 taxis in major cities across China – and
        accessing a direct channel to China’s most affluent,
        mobile audience with higher than average disposable

         i-level and Smartwin to Explore 3G Technology for Next
                    Generation Mobile Media Platform

        SHANGHAI, China, May 14, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) --
        i-level Media Group Inc. (OTC BB:ILVL.OB - News) and
        its technology partner, Smartwin Technology Ltd.,
        announced today they have agreed to begin working
        together on researching applications of 3G
        communication technologies suitable for mobile digital
        media networks, in anticipation of China's launch of
        TD-SCDMA late this year.

        The adoption of 3G communication technology is expected
        to create numerous new opportunities in the wireless
        and digital media sectors through its increased data
        transmission rates and breadth of services. i-level
        expects that this will eventually allow for multiple
        new functions and applications to be developed and
        added to its current media platform.

        Ian Sullivan, Vice-President and COO of i-level,
        commented on the announcement, saying, ``We look
        forward to deepening our relationship with Smartwin
        Technology-an important partner and a truly innovative
        industry leader-and developing exciting,
        next-generation digital media solutions for i-level and
        our partners.''

        i-level and Smartwin have been working together for
        more than 2 years on digital media solutions for the
        transportation industry. Together they designed and
        developed i-level's multimedia advertising display
        units (``ADUs''), which are currently in operation in
        more than 3000 taxis in Shanghai. As i-level expands
        its network of taxi-based ADUs across China, the
        Company plans to continue looking for technological
        improvements that could better the viewing experience
        for passengers or facilitate the management of media
        networks.

        "Smartwin is committed to developing cutting edge
        solutions for our clients in the digital media and
        transportation space," commented Smartwin Technology's
        President, David Leung. "China is working on its own 3G
        network standard and we intend on being ready to take
        advantage of this new technology and the opportunities
        it will present."

        taxi association, the China Taxicab and Livery
        Association ("CTLA" or " the association"), as the
        association's first foreign-owned member.

        As a full member of the CTLA, i-level will enjoy direct
        access to all of the association's members through
        industry conferences, monthly newsletters, and the
        association's website (http://www.chinatla.com). The
        CTLA currently has more than 600 members that operate
        in and around China's taxi industry, including taxi
        operators, vehicle manufacturers, service providers,
        and government bodies. In granting membership to
        i-level, the CTLA and its management has recognized the
        merits of i-level's digital media platform and
        confirmed i-level's reputation as China's premier
        digital taxi media company.

        CTLA Vice Chairman Mr. Wei Bin Fan stated that "The
        association is proud to admit i-level to its membership
        roster and looks forward to working together towards
        the betterment of the taxi riding experience for
        passengers, drivers and operators across China."

        "We are honored to be the first foreign-owned company
        to be admitted to the CTLA," stated Aidan Sullivan,
        President and CEO of i-level. "The association has a
        long history and a deep understanding of the taxi
        business inching, and we are very pleased to have their
        support as we expand i-level's network throughout the
        Chinese market."

        Both parties have agreed to work together to ensure
        that the Company's digital taxi media platform, the
        i-level Mobile Media Network, continues to comply with
        all regulations governing the taxi industry, and to
        establish the digital media standard that can be
        promoted nationwide to members of the association.

        delivering powerful digital media solutions for
        out-of-home advertising in China. The company owns and
        operates one of the largest digital in-taxi advertising

<p>Dear Reader,
<p>The only thing better than a growth market is a growth market <i>inside</i>
a growth market.&nbsp; That could certainly describe the opportunity before
<b>i-level Media Group (OTCBB: ILVL), </b>an emerging media company delivering
powerful digital media solutions for out-of-home advertising (“OA”) in
the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).&nbsp; The company is focused on
an underdeveloped market niche with enormous potential - <u>Digital media
advertising in taxis.</u>.&nbsp; With thousands of its LCD advertising
screens installed in taxis across China already, i-level appears to be
at the forefront of a huge opportunity.
<p>Moreover, the company announced an agreement today that will give ILVL
exclusive access to 3,200 additional taxis in Beijing.&nbsp; This entry
into China's capital city marks a major milestone for i-level as Beijing
is critical to the success of i-level's national mobile media network strategy.
This contract along with others the company has previously put in place
positions i-level for continued rapid growth.&nbsp; With a potential market
of over 60,000 taxis currently in service in Beijing and the 2008 Olympics
just around the corner, Beijing is an ideal market for ILVL.(<b>See Breaking
<font color="#990000">NEWS</font> Below</b>)
