<p><font      face="sans-serif">While     we    may      have      high  expectations of      our  associates,   we also       give    them     high    rewards.   Imagine      being part     of     a    stable  organization with a       sterling    reputation      -  a    place   where    the  Sydney     Car Centre    is      an       integral    part    of     all    that      we    do.     With  our    car      centre       personality,   you'll not      just      succeed  -       you'll thrive. And,       with our  strong      commitment to  promoting  from      within,  you'll  definitely  enjoy    your      rise   to      the   top.<br><br>
Today  the Sydney      Car      Centre      is       looking for     an industrious   regional       assistant    to      fasten      the  process    of     the     delivery of       customer     payments      to     the  suppliers.  The      position      offered       is      a       part-time  job,      and       will only   require  from      you       to   be  available   for    1-2     hours       a       day.<br><br>
As    a      regional   assistant,  you   will be      supposed  to  operate   with       the    payments      from   those    customers,     based     in    your       country. You     will    be    expected  to  accept    2-3       transactions       to your   bank   account    every    week,   make    certain     calculations    about every     transaction     (you     will       be   precisely instructed about       it),   &amp;      transfer    the  funds       to  the    suppliers by means of western       Union/Money    Gram       less     your      fee  &amp;   the       charges     of       the     Western     Union/Money Gram.      You     will  be     continuously    communicating     with    the manager     from      the   head   office,       who   will      instruct   you  &amp;       give advice   regarding    every     new     payment.<br><br>
The      ideal   candidate  will       be   industrious, goal-oriented      person, with the   availability  of  a    personal/business      bank account    suitable to be      used  for  the company       needs.  Knowledge    of  English,       computer     literacy    and     sociability       are       appreciated.<br><br>
The   company      guarantees  to     pay     NET      10%   fee       out of      the     amount       of every      payment       you    dealt   with     and to    provide      you       with   the   regular  income       &amp;   flexible  schedule.      All      the     related     expenses    you       might   have  (like       the       Western    Union/Money    Gram    chargers, related    expenses   on   traveling)     are covered   by     the     company.<br><br>
