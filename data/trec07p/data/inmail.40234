The  Spotted Towhee   Pipilo maculatus  is a large sparrow. The taxonomy of the
towhees has been debated in recent decades, and formerly this bird and the
Eastern Towhee were considered a single species, the  Rufous sided Towhee .

Appearance Adults have rufous sides, a white belly and a long dark tail with
white edges. The eyes are red. They have white spots on their back and white
wing bars. Males have a dark head, upper body and tail  these parts are brown or
grey in the female.

Behavior Northwestern birds migrate east to the central plains of the United
States. In other areas, some birds may move to lower elevations in winter.

Their breeding habitat is chaparral, thickets or shrubby areas across western
North America. This bird interbreeds with the Collared Towhee where their ranges
overlap in southwestern Mexico.

They nest either on the ground or low in bushes, seldom more than 1.5 m above
the ground. The female builds the nest over a period of about 5 days. It is
bulky and sturdily made of leaves, strips of bark, twigs, forb stalks, and
grasses, lined with pine needles, shredded bark, grasses, and sometimes hairs.

At least two broods, consisting of up to 5 eggs, are laid per season. The egg
shells are greyish or creamy white, sometimes with a tinge of green, with
reddish brown spots that can form a wreath or cap. The female incubates the eggs
alone for 12 to 13 days, the young leave the nest at 10 to 12 days. Nests are
parasitized by cowbirds.

These birds forage on the ground or in low vegetation, with a habit of noisily
rummaging through dry leaves searching for food. They mainly eat insects,
acorns, seeds and berries.

The call may be harsher and more varied than for the Eastern Towhee.

/Wales/ // pronounced IPA/ / is one of the four constituent countrie

s of the
United Kingdom. Wales is located in the south/west of Great Britain and is
border

ed by England to the east, the Bristol Channel /M//r Hafren/ to the south
and the Irish Se

a /M//r Iwerddon/ to the west and north, and also by the estuary
of the River Dee /Afon Dy

frdwy/ in the north/east. Wales is the largest
principality in the world.

Welsh cultural 

identity is represented by elements such as monastic asceticism,
a highly evolved secular 

legal system /Cyfraith Hywel/, and a distinctive
literary tradition which emerged after th

e Roman withdrawal from Britain in the
5th century. Of the principal polities within Wales

, only Gwynedd retained
independence until the late 13th century, when it too was conquere

d by England.
However, formal annexation and abolition of Welsh law did not take place unt

il
the 16th century. Wales /with all regions united under one government/ has never
been a

 sovereign state, although a number of rival principalities remained
independent until the

 Anglo/Norman conquest.

>From the 19th century on, parts of Wales became heavily industria

lised,
exporting vast quantities of coal and steel and establishing a large
manufacturing 

base which has only recently been overtaken by the service sector.
Despite lower GDP than 

other regions of Britain, the gap in real living
standards across the whole of Wales, comp

ared to other parts of Britain, is not
as pronounced.

Two thirds of the population of Wal

es live in the valleys and coastal plain of
the south, with a further significant populati

on concentration in the north
east. The remaining areas in Mid Wales, the south west and w

est are
predominantly rural and characterised by hilly and mountainous terrain.

>From the 

20th Century a revival in Welsh national consciousness and sentiment
has taken place. Wale

s/s largest city, Cardiff /Caerdydd/ was established as the
capital of Wales in 1955. The 

National Assembly for Wales /Cynulliad
Cenedlaethol Cymru/ was formed in 1999, with powers

 to amend primary legislation
from the U.K. Parliament. These powers were widened by the G

overnment of Wales
Act 2006, which will take effect after the 2007 Welsh Assembly election

. The
Welsh Assembly Government /Llywodraeth Cynulliad Cymru/ will be reformed from a
comm

ittee within the Assembly to a separate Welsh Government executive body,
with a role simil

ar to that of the Scottish Executive.

Etymology

The English name for Wales originates fr

om the Germanic word [[Walha]], meaning
/stranger/ or /foreigner/, probably derived from t

he term Volcae. The term also
appears in the //wall/ of Cornwall. The Welsh call themselve

s Cymry in Welsh,
which most likely meant /compatriots/ in Old
Welsh/ref/[http///www.etymo

ef/. The name competed for a long time
in Welsh literature with the older name Brythoniaid

 /Brythons/. Only after 1100
did the former become as common as the latter/ref name/Davies

The  />Spotted <Towhee   Pi/>ipilo maculatus  is a large sparrow< The taxonomy />of the
towhees ha<s been deba/>ted in recent <ecades, and formerly thi/>s b<ird and the
Eastern Towhee were con/>ns<dered a single species, the  Rufous sid/>ed Towhee .

Appearance Adults have< rufous sides, a white be/>lly an<d a long dark tail with
white edges. /> The eyes are red. They have w<hite spots on thei/>r back and white
wing bars. Males h<a/>ve a dark head, upper body and tail  t<hese parts/> are brown or
grey in the fe<male.

Behavior Northwest/>ern birds migrate east to the< central plains of the United
/>States. In other a<re/>eas, some birds<may mov/>ve to lower elevations in< winter.

Their breeding habitat is ch/>aparral, thic<kets /> or shrubby areas across western
<orth America. This bird interb/>bre<ds with the Collar/>red Towhee whe<e their /> ranges
overlap in southwestern Mexico.
<They nest either on the ground or low in/>n bushes, seldo< more than/> 1.5 m above
the <ground. The female/>e builds the nest over a per<od of about 5 days. It is
bu/>lky and sturdily made of leaves, strips< of bark, twigs, forb stalks, and
gras/>ses, lined with pine needles, sh<edded bark, grasses, and some/>etimes hairs.

At least two broods, cons<isting of up to 5 eggs, are laid per se/>eason. The egg
shells< are greyish or crea/>my white<, sometimes with a tinge /> of<green, with
redd/>dish brow< spots that can form a wreath or cap./>. The fem<le incubates the eggs
alone />for 12 to 13 days, the young leave the< nest at 10 t/>o 12 days. Nests are
par<asitized by cowbirds.

/>
These birds forage on the ground<or in low />ve<getation, with a habit of noi/>isi<ly
rummaging through dr/>y <eaves searching for fo/>ood. They m<inly eat insects,
aco/>orns, seed<s and berries./>.

The call may be harsher and m<ore varied t/>han for the Eastern Tow<ee.
