Tired of the routine 9-5 and want to stay at your place instead?

No traffic, no frustrating co-workers...heck stay in your PJs all day.

Well if you have a phone and can return calls then this is for you.

Call to hear the message on how myself and others do this every single day
and have a blast while doing it.

Dial 1-8OO-679-O1O8 to hear how.



Ok so this is not for everyone but you have to let us know. Send back a reply to let us know.




All Harriet Tubman's trips were successful because she was a master in planning the strategy of each of her escape operations. No detail was missed by her. She planned for food, clothing, train tickets and forged passes. She even included sedatives for crying babies. She never lost a passenger. On at least one occasion, she threatened to shoot a passenger who had second thoughts about escaping. The overnight stops on what came to be know as the Underground Railroad were a network of homes and churches. The churches raised money to assist Tubman's efforts.
