It was a great tree, he thought, and they had grown up together. He laid his hardened palm on it, and fancied that he caught a throb of the silent vitality under the bark. How many kinds of life there were! Under its white shroud, how all the valley lived.

Ive just sold a piece of timber land I never thought to get a cent out of, and thatll ease things up so we can hire help if she aint strong enough to do the work.
