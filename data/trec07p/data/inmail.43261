The Great Dane is the large hunting dog of the Dan  r tribe,    Dene    in the
poem  Beowulf , today   s Danes.

In Old Norse  ON  and Old English  OE  the male is always referred to as
   Hund     in etymology from    the Hunt/Hunter     and the female as
   grey/grig   . This division can still be seen in the hunting protocols from
the Royal Kennels of the Royal Court of Denmark year 1710 36  may be seen at the
National Archives, Denmark .

Thus in Norse and Old English literature, specifically the compilation of sagas
known as Elder Edda  Poetic Edda , the hound is named in variations over these
words, for example    hvndar    and    greyiom      Sk  rnism  l , verse 11,
Elder Edda  br    mj  hundr/myo hwnd/mj  hund, meaning  slender hound  or
sighthound  Scanian Law from 1200/1250 

As the original purpose of the hound was to be able to take on the wild boar,
the Deer and the wolf we often see kennings applied that identify Odin   s two
hounds as wolfhounds. As the king   s personal hounds it is the very same hound
that guards the entrance to the next world in both Denmark and England, the
folklore of which forms the basis for    The Hound of the Baskervilles     see
Black Shuck .

The large hound, alongside the horse and the raven, is holy to the kings of
Denmark and England. We see this both in the common language at the time and in
the buried treasure of the kings and queens.

The large hound appears to be a migration dog. It arrives in the landscapes of
the Danes in two migrations  Firstly with the Celts in the 5th Century BCE  see
the Gundestrup cauldron,  Plate E  Warrior Initiation  under the cauldron  and
secondly with the Danes as they begin to settle year 40 77 ACE.

Uniquely The Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen Faculty of Science has
a collection of dog skeletons from both periods and thereafter well in to the
Middle Ages. The dogs were buried alongside their owners, male and female, as
guiding spirits to the next world. None exists prior to this period. The large
hounds are 61 70 cm tall over the shoulder  see the Ladby ship .

The most treasured hound, as is the case with the horse, is the white colored
with black markings. Today we know this hound as    Harlequin/Harlekin   
 English/ Danish . However the origin is    Herla Cyning     OE  or    King of
the Army   . The word evolves because the human king is titled Hariwalda
 ON/OE , in the new kingdoms in Britannia evolving to    Bretwalda    or
   ruler of the army/Britannia   . His personal hounds in white are rulers of
all dogs.

Two large hounds can be seen on    The Royal Purse Lid     The British Museum 
as guiding spirits to the king buried in Sutton Hoo, East Anglia, presumably
 H R  dwald in the 7th Century ACE.

Likewise the large hound is depicted on the engravings of the Golden horns of
Gallehus from Southern Jutland, Denmark dated to the 5th Century ACE and on
numerous rune stones  see the Tj  ngvide and Ledberg Runestone  and engravings
on Viking ships used for burial purposes  see Oseberg ship . The depictions
continue uninterrupted in church paintings and murals up until today.

The original large hound was lighter in construction than the current one. We
know this both from art and from the royal hunting protocols. We also know what
caused this to change, when and how.



Towards the end of the 16th Century the Royal Court of Denmark introduced the
new fashion of the Parforce Hunt     an unnatural hunt where the hunting </STYLE>

/Reading/ is a process of retrieving and comprehending some form of stored
inf

ormation or ideas. These ideas are usually some sort of representation of
language, such a

s symbols to be examined by sight, or by touch /for example
Braille/. Other types of readi

ng may not be text/based, such as music notation
or pictograms. By analogy, in computer sc

ience, reading is acquiring of data
from some sort of computer storage.

Although reading 

is now a primary means for most people to receive information
this has been the case only 

for the last 150 years or so /mdash/ with some
exceptions only a small percentage of the p

opulation in any country was literate
before the industrial revolution.

You are reading a

t this very moment.

Rates

Rates of reading include reading for memorization /under 100 w

ords per minute
/wpm//, reading for learning /100/ndash/200 wpm/, reading for comprehensio

n
/200/ndash/400 wpm/, and skimming /400/ndash/700 wpm/. Reading for comprehension
is the 

essence of most people///s daily reading. Skimming is sometimes useful
for processing larg

er quantities of text superficially at a much lower level of
comprehension /below 50//.

A

dvice for the appropriate choice of reading rate includes reading flexibly,
slowing down w

hen the concepts are closer together or when the material is
unfamiliar, and speeding up w

hen the material is familiar and the material is
not concept rich. Speed reading courses a

nd books often encourage the reader to
continually speed up/ comprehension tests lead the 

reader to believe their
comprehension is constantly improving. However, competence in read

ing involves
the understanding that skimming is dangerous as a default habit.

Types and m

ethods

We can identify several types and methods of reading, with differing rates that
ca

n be attained for each, for different kinds of material and purposes/

//[[Subvocalization

/Subvocalized]]/ reading combines sight reading with internal
sounding of the words as if 

spoken. It can be a bad habit that slows reading and
comprehension, if applied to all read

ing material, but it can also be essential
for reading things like poetry or transcripts o

f oral speeches. //[[Speed
reading]]/ is a collection of methods for increasing reading sp

eed without an
unacceptable reduction in comprehension or retention. closely connected to 

speed
learning. //[[Proofreading]]/ is a kind of reading for the purpose of detecting
typo

graphical errors. One can learn to do it rapidly, and professional
proofreaders typically 

acquire the ability to do so at high rates, faster for
some kinds of material than for oth

ers, while they may largely suspend
comprehension while doing so, except when needed to se

lect among several
possible words that a suspected typographic error allows. //Structure/P

roposition/
Evaluation /SPE// method, popularized by Mortimer Adler in [[How to Read a
Boo

k]], mainly for non/fiction treatise, in which one reads a writing in three
passes/ /1/ fo

r the structure of the work, which might be represented by an
outline/ /2/ for the logical

 propositions made, organized into chains of
inference/ and /3/ for evaluation of the meri

ts of the arguments and
conclusions. This method involves suspended judgment of the work o

r its
arguments until they are fully understood. //Survey/Question/Read/Recite/Review
/[[S

Q3R]]// method, often taught in public schools, which involves reading
toward being able t

o teach what is read, and would be appropriate for
instructors preparing to teach material

 without having to refer to notes during
the lecture.

Skill development


Several methods

 of teaching and learning to read have developed, and become
somewhat controversial/

//[[

Phonics]]/ involves teaching reading by associating characters or groups of
characters wit

h sounds. Sometimes argued to be in competition with whole
language methods. //[[Whole lan

guage]]/ methods involve acquiring words or
phrases without attention to the characters or

 groups of characters that compose
them. Sometimes argued to be in competition with phonic

s methods, and that the
whole language approach tends to impair learning how to spell.

/W

hy Neither Phonics Nor Whole Language is Completely Successful/ In comparison
to other alp

habetic languages, neither the phonics nor the whole language method
is an unquestionably 

successful teaching method in the English language. This is
the reason that these methods 

are described above as being ///somewhat
controversial/// and the reason it is stated abov

e that the whole language
method ///tends to impair learning how to spell.///

Both the ph

onics and the whole word methods labor to overcome what is actually a
defect in the writte

n representation of the English language. Contrary to the
logical purpose of an alphabetic

 language, the letters used to spell the words
in English have been effectively divorced f

rom the sounds used in pronouncing
the words. This is due primarily to a serious error mad

e by Dr. Samuel Johnson
when he prepared his dictionary of the English language in 1755. A

lthough there
had been other dictionaries prior to Johnson///s dictionary, none of them we

re
as widely accepted and as authoritative as Johnson///s dictionary.

The English languag

e grew and changed over the centuries. By the time
Johnson///s dictionary was prepared, th

e English language was a conglomeration
of many words from eight different major language 

sources and included words
from the original occupants of the British Isles and those adop

ted from every
conquering nation that occupied the British Isles./ref/Frank C. Laubach,
Te

aching the World to Read /New York/ Friendship Press, 1947/, pp. 100/102//ref/

The Great Dane is the/>e large hunting dog o< the Da/>an  r tribe,<   Dene    in the
p/>po<m  Beowulf , today   s Danes.

In Ol/>ld Norse  ON  and Old English <OE  the male/>e is always referred <o as
   Hund     in /> etymol<gy from    the Hun/>t/Hunter<     and/> the <emale as
   gr/>rey/grig < . This division can still be seen in t/>the hunting<protocols from
the Royal Kennel/>ls of the Royal Court of De<nmark year 1710 36  may />be seen at the
Na<tional Archives, Denmark ./>

Thus in Norse and Old E<nglish literature, specifica/>lly the comp<ila/>tion of sagas
known as Eld<er Edda  Poetic Edda , the hound is nam/>ed in variations over <these
w/>w<rds, for example    hvn/>dar    and    greyiom      <Sk  rnism  l , verse 11,
Elder E/>dda  <r    mj  hundr/m/>yo hwnd/mj  hund, meaning  slen<der hound  or
sighthound  Scanian Law f/>from 1200/1250 

As the or<iginal purpose of the hound was to be a/>ble to take on the wil<d boar,
the Deer and the wolf we often/>n see kennings app<ied that identify Odi/>in   s two
hounds a< wolfhounds. As the king   s pers/>onal hounds it is< the very/>y same ho<nd

The large/> hound, alongside t<he ho/>rse and the raven, is ho<y/> to the kings of

houn<ds are 61 70 cm tall over the shoul/>der  see the Ladby shi< .

The most treasured hound, as is the/> case with the horse, is <the whi/>t< c/>colored
with black mark<ings. Today we know th/>his hound as    Harlequin/Harle<in   />
