A full 100 mg. will give you a Ginsu carving knife that, if put to ultimate use, 
will render her suitable for burial in a Y-shaped coffin.  For most of us, 50 mg. is 
plenty, ensuring that you can return to a deflated state between orgasms, if so desired...
But you may have to picture your grandmother naked, to do so.
The effects last 3 or 4 hours, and it takes 30 to 45 minutes to kick in. 25 or 50 mg tabs 
work the same for me, no difference. Go for it... - Art, Age 62, Texas

Our main priority is the indubitable quality of meds sold at our online pharmacy!
