   The  reindeer , known as  caribou  when wild in North America, is an Arctic
and Subarctic dwelling deer  Rangifer tarandus .

Habitat The  reindeer  is distributed throughout a number of northern locales.
Reindeer are found throughout Norway and Iceland and the northern parts of
Sweden and Finland  at Spitsbergen  in European parts of Russia including
Northern Russia and Novaya Zemlya  in the Asian parts of Russia, to the Pacific
Ocean  in North America  where it is called the  caribou   on Greenland, Canada
and Alaska. In 1952 reindeer were re introduced to Scotland, as the natural
stock had become extinct in the 10th century.

Domesticated reindeer are mostly found in northern Scandinavia and Russia, and
wild reindeer are mostly found in North America, Greenland and Iceland  where
they were introduced by humans in the 18th century . The last wild reindeer in
Europe are found in portions of southern Norway. The southern boundary of the
species  natural range is approximately at 62   north latitude.

A few reindeer from Norway were introduced to the South Atlantic island of South
Georgia in the beginning of the 20th century. Today there are two distinct herds
still thriving there, permanently separated by glaciers. Their total numbers are
no more than a few thousand.  The flag and the coat of arms of the territory
contain an image of a reindeer. 

Anatomy


The weight of a female varies between 60 and 170 kg. In some subspecies of
reindeer, the male is slightly larger  in others, the male can weigh up to 300
kg. Both sexes grow antlers, which  in the Scandinavian variety  for old males
fall off in December, for young males in the early spring, and for females,
summer. The antlers typically have two separate groups of points  see image , a
lower and upper. Domesticated reindeer are shorter legged and heavier than their
wild counterparts. The caribou of North America can run at speeds up to 50 miles
per hour and may travel 3,000 miles in a year.

Reindeer are ruminants, having a four chambered stomach. They mainly eat lichens
in winter, especially reindeer moss. However, they also eat the leaves of
willows and birches, as well as sedges and grasses. There is some evidence to
suggest that on occasion they will also feed on lemmings ref [http //www.fielda

Reindeer have specialized noses featuring nasal turbinate bones that
dramatically increase the surface area within the nostrils. Incoming cold air is
warmed by the animal s body heat before entering the lungs, and water is
condensed from the expired air and captured before the deer s breath is exhaled,
used to moisten dry incoming air and possibly absorbed into the blood through
the mucous membranes.

Reindeer hooves adapt to the season  in the summer, when the tundra is soft and
wet, the footpads become spongy and provide extra traction. In the winter, the
pads shrink and tighten, exposing the rim of the hoof which cuts into the ice
and crusted snow to keep the animal from slipping. This also enables them to dig
down  an activity known as  cratering   ref name cratering  In the winter, the
fleshy pads on these toes grow longer and form a tough, hornlike rim. Caribou
use these large, sharp edged hooves to dig through the snow and uncover the
lichens that sustain them in winter months. Biologists call this activity
   cratering    because of the crater like cavity the caribou   s hooves leave
in the snow.  [http //www.taiga.net/projectcaribou/pdf/allaboutcaribou.PDF All

32.htm Image of reindeer cratering in snow.] /ref  through the snow to their
favorite food  a lichen known as reindeer moss 

The reindeer coat has two layers of fur, a dense woolly undercoat and longer 
haired overcoat consisting of hollow, air filled hairs. A caribou or reindeer
swims easily and fast  migrating herds will not hesitate to swim across a large
lake or broad river.

Population ]]

In the wild, most caribou migrate in large herds between their birthing habitat
and their winter habitat. Their wide hooves help the animals move through snow
and tundra  they also help propel the animal when it swims. About 1 million live
in Alaska, and a comparable number live in northern Canada.

There are an estimated 5 million reindeer in Eurasia, mainly semi domesticated.
The last remaining European herds of the genetic wild reindeer  of the
subspecies tarandus  are found in central Norway, mainly in the mountainous
areas of Rondane, Dovrefjell Sunndalsfjella  see Dovrefjell Sunndalsfjella
National Park , Hardangervidda and Setesdalsheiene. Genetic analysis has shown
this, and that the reindeer in Rondane and Dovrefjell is of Beringia origin,
other wild Norwegian reindeer are of European origin and have interbred with
domesticated reindeer to a various extent, the reindeer in Hardangervidda and
Setesdalsheiane only to a limited extent. Some areas, such as Filefjell, have

/Bodybuilding/ is the process of developing muscle fibres through the
combination of weig

ht training, sufficient caloric intake, and rest. Someone who
engages in this activity is 

referred to as a /bodybuilder/. As a sport, called
competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders 

display their physiques to a panel of
judges, who assign points based on their aesthetic a

ppearance. The muscles are
revealed through a combination of fat loss, oils, and tanning /

or tanning
lotions/ which combined with lighting make the definition of the muscle group
m

ore distinct. Famous bodybuilders include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mike Mentzer,
Lou Ferrign

o, Steve Reeves, Serge Nubret, Larry Scott, Ronnie Coleman, and Jay
Cutler.

History Early

 years

The /Early Years/ of Bodybuilding are considered to be the period between 1880
and

 1930.

Bodybuilding /the art of displaying the muscles/ did not really exist prior to
the

 late 19th century, when it was promoted by a man from Prussia named Eugen
Sandow,/ref nam

e//SandowMuseum//Sandow/ Historic Photographs of Early
Bodybuilders / The Sandow Museum/ H

istory of Bodybuilding / A Tribute to Eugen
Sandow [http///www.sandowmuseum.com/ Homepage]

//ref/ who is now generally
referred to as /The Father of Modern Bodybuilding/. He is cred

ited as being a
pioneer of the sport because he allowed an audience to enjoy viewing his
p

hysique in /muscle display performances/. Although audiences thrilled seeing a
well develo

ped physique, those men simply displayed their bodies as part of
strength demonstrations o

r wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built
around these displays through his manag

er, Florenz Ziegfeld. He became so
successful at it, he later created several businesses a

round his fame and was
among the first to market products branded with his name alone. As 

he became
more popular, he was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise
equi

pment for the masses /machined dumbbells, spring pulleys and tension bands/.

Sandow was a

 strong advocate of /the Grecian Ideal/ /this was a standard where a
mathematical /ideal/ 

was set up and the /perfect physique/ was close to the
proportions of ancient Greek and Ro

man statues from classical times/. This is
how Sandow built his own physique and in the ea

rly years, men were judged by how
closely they matched these /ideal/ proportions. Sandow o

rganised the first
bodybuilding contest on 14 September, 1901 called the /Great Competitio

n/ and
held in the Royal Albert Hall, London, UK. Judged by himself, Sir Charles Lawes,
an

d Sir Arthur Conan Doyle the contest was a huge success and was sold out and
hundreds of p

hysical culture enthusiasts were turned away. The trophy presented
to the winner was a bro

nze statue of Sandow himself sculpted by Frederick
Pomeroy. The winner was William L. Murr

ay of Nottingham, England. The most
prestigious bodybuilding contest today is the Mr. Olym

pia, and since 1977, the
winner has been presented with the same bronze statue of Sandow h

e himself
presented to the winner at the first contest./ref

On 16 January, 1904, the first large/scale bodybuilding compe

tition in America
took place at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The winner was Al 

Treloar
and he was declared /The Most Perfectly Developed Man in the World/. Treloar won
a

 $1,000 cash prize, a substantial sum at that time. Two weeks later, Thomas
Edison made a 

film of Al Treloar/s posing routine. Edison also made two films of
Sandow a few years befo

re, making him the man who made the first three motion
pictures featuring a bodybuilder. I

n the early 20th century, Bernarr Macfadden
and Charles Atlas, continued to promote bodybu

ilding across the world. Alois P.
Swoboda was an early pioneer in America and the man who 

Charles Atlas credited
with his success in his statement/ /Everything that I know I learne

d from A. P.
/Alois/ Swoboda./

Other important bodybuilders in the early history of bodyb

uilding prior to 1930
include/ Earle Liederman /writer of some of the earliest bodybuildin

g
instruction books/, Seigmund Breitbart /famous Jewish bodybuilder/, Georg
Hackenschmidt,

 George F. Jowett, Maxick /a pioneer in the art of posing/, Monte
Saldo, Launceston Elliot

, Sig Klein, Sgt. Alfred Moss, Joe Nordquist, Lionel
Strongfort /Strongfortism/, Gustav Fr

istensky /the Czech champion/, and Alan C.
Mead, who became an impressive muscle champion 

despite the fact that he lost a
leg in the Great War.

The /Golden Age/ The period of arou

nd 1940 to 1970 is often referred to as the
/Golden Age/ of bodybuilding because of change

s in the aesthetic for more mass,
as well as muscular symmetry and definition, which chara

cterised the /early
years/. This was due in large part to the advent of World War II, whic

h inspired
many young men to be bigger, stronger and more aggressive in their attitudes.

   The  rein<deer , known as  carib/>ou  when wild in North< Amer/>ica, is an Arctic<and Subarctic dwelli/>ing deer  Rangifer tarandus .

Habit<t The  reindeer  is distributed t/>hroughout a number of <northern locales.
Reindee/>er are found throughout Norway <nd Iceland and the north/>e<rn parts of
Swede/>en and F<inland  at Spitsbergen  in European /> parts of Russia including
N<rther/>n Russia and Novaya Zem<lya  in the A/>Asian parts of<Russia, to the Pacifi/>c
Ocean  in N<orth America  where it is cal/>led the  caribou   on Greenland< Canada
and Alaska. In 1952 re/>eindeer were re intro<uced to />Scotland, as the natural
stock< had />becom<e extinct in the 10th century.

Domest/>ticated reindeer are<mostly found in northern Scand/>dinavia a<nd R/>Russia, and
wild reindeer are mostly fou<nd in North America, Gree/>nland and Iceland  where
they were int<roduced by/> humans in <he 18th cen/>ntury . The l<st wild reindeer in
Europe are /> found in por<tions of/> southern Norway. The southern bounda<ry of the
species  natural range is a/>pproximately at 62   <north latitude.

A few rei/>ndeer from Norway we<re introduced to the South Atlantic isla/>nd of South
Georgia in <he beginning of the 20th century./>. Today there are two dist<inct herds
still t/>hriving t<here, permanently separated /> by glaciers. Their<total numbers are
no more than a few tho/>o<usand.  The flag and the coat of />arms of the territory
contain an image <f a reindeer. 

Anatomy


The weight of/>f a female varies between 60 and 17<0 kg. In some subspecies of
reindeer, />the male is slightly <larger  in others, the male can weigh up/> to 300
kg. Both sexes grow antl<rs, which  in /> the Scandinavian variety  for o<ld males
fall off in Decembe/>r, for young males in the early<spring, a/>an<d for females,
s/>ummer. The antlers typically have two se<arate />groups of points  see image , a
lower a<d upper. Domesticated reindeer are s/>horter legged and heavier<than their
wild counterparts. Th/>he caribou of North Ame<rica/> can run at spe<ds up to 50 miles
per hour and />may travel 3,000 miles <in a year.

Reindeer are rum/>minants,<having a four chambered stomach. They />mainly eat lichens
in winter, especiall<y reindeer moss. Howeve/>r, they also ea<t the leaves of
willows and bir/>ches, as well as sedges an<d grasses. There is some evidence/> to
suggest that on occasion they will <also feed on lemmin/>ngs ref [http //www.fielda

Reindeer ha/>ave specialized noses featuring<nasal turbinate/> bones that
drama<ically increase the su/>urface area within the n<o/>strils. Inc<oming cold air is
warmed by t/>the animal s body h<at before entering the lungs, and water/> is
c<ndensed from the ex/>xpired air and capture<d before the deer s breath is exhaled,
u/>sed to moisten dry in<coming air and po/>ssibly <bsor/>rbed into the <lood through

Reindeer hooves adapt to< the seas/>son  in the summer, when the tundr< is soft an/>nd
