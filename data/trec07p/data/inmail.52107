Money Gram or Western Union Money Transfer).

HOW MUCH WILL YOU EARN?
10% from each operation! For instance: you receive 7000 USD via checks or
money orders on our behalf. You will cash the money and keep $700 (10%
from $7000) for yourself! At the beginning your commission will equal 10%,
though
later it will increase up to 12%!

its nice you acknowledge the simplicity of the nature of the job,though it
seems simple it means a great deal to us,for your questions

FIRSTLY you dont need a business name,the money orders would be made out
in your original name so you can have the check cashed at your bank or any
cash service point around you,

SECONDLY you dont need a post office because the money orders would be
sent to you via fedex or ups all we require is your contact address so we
could have fedex or u.p.s deliver the money order to you inperson



THIRDLY The western union or money gram charges should be deducted from
the companies money it should not affect your own 10% commission with the
