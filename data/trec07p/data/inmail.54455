<STRONG>Phone: (24 hours): +234-8055479170<BR>Email: 
osite111@yahoo.co.uk<BR><BR>I am the chairman of the contract award 
committee of the oil ministry here in Nigeria, for security reasons, I may 
not wish to disclose how I got your email address for now. <BR><BR>After due 
deliberation with my partner, I decided to forward to you this business 
proposal, we want you to assist us receive the sum of Twenty eight million, 
six hundred thousand united state bills(us28.6m) into your account. This 
fund resulted from an over-invoiced contract awarded by us under the budget 
allocation to my ministry and the bill was approved for payment by the 
concerned ministries. The contract was executed, commissioned and the 
contractor was paid his actual cost of the contract. Now, we are left with 
the balance of us28.6m as the over invoiced amount, which we have 
deliberately over estimated for our own use. Please note that the law 
forbids civil servants to perate or own foreign accounts hence this contact, 
we have agreed to share the money in the following ercentages: 30 for you, 
60 for us 10 for tax as may be required by your government. <BR><BR>Note 
that this transaction is very much free from all sorts of risk hence the 
business was carefully planned before it was successfully executed and we 
the officials involved in the deal have put many years in service to our 
ministry. We have been exercising patience for this privilege for so long 
not until the presidential nnouncement last week, that all foreign 
contractors owed be paid forthwith, this will enable the presidency 
<BR>reconcile our debt ratio with the outside world and to most of us, this 
is a lifetime blessing we cannot afford to miss. Upon indication of your 
interest to fully co-operate with us, a payment application/information form 
will be sent to you via email for completion. <BR><BR>Note that the 
following information: a) bankers name and address, b) account number and 
account name and c) your private phone number and email address <BR>will 
enable us seek/secure approval of the fund from the concerned government 
quarters/ministries within 3-4 banking days. <BR><BR>As soon as we confirm 
receipt of this money in your nominated bank account, my partner and I will 
come over to your country to arrange for our own share <BR>and possibly 
invest part of this money in your country. <BR><BR>Let honesty and trust be 
our watchword throughout this transaction. I shall furnish you with some 
details about myself. Your prompt reply will be highly <BR>appreciated. 
<BR>Best regards. <BR><BR>Engr.St.michael Adams<BR></STRONG>
