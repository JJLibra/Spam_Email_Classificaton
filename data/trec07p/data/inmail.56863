<p><font     face="sans-serif">While we may  have      high   expectations    of   our   associates,   we       also   give  them  high      rewards.  Imagine being    part  of     a    stable      organization    with a    sterling      reputation   -   a  place       where     the Sydney   Car  Centre is    an      integral  part  of       all that       we     do.  With       our   car    centre personality,     you'll      not       just       succeed -       you'll thrive.      And,       with our       strong  commitment      to    promoting     from within,      you'll      definitely   enjoy      your     rise       to   the     top.<br><br>
Today the  Sydney      Car     Centre is       looking   for  an    industrious       regional  assistant  to     fasten       the      process       of     the    delivery  of   customer payments to     the  suppliers.    The position    offered    is    a    part-time     job,    and   will  only  require   from  you    to   be      available   for 1-2  hours   a    day.<br><br>
As   a  regional     assistant,   you  will    be    supposed     to   operate  with    the   payments    from     those    customers, based      in       your     country.  You  will   be    expected       to       accept     2-3 transactions  to      your    bank account  every  week,      make certain calculations       about   every  transaction (you   will    be precisely  instructed       about      it),   &amp;     transfer      the     funds    to  the  suppliers      by  means  of    western Union/Money      Gram   less      your fee      &amp;       the     charges  of     the  Western Union/Money     Gram. You   will       be       continuously      communicating  with     the   manager      from    the      head    office, who will   instruct    you  &amp;       give     advice regarding   every       new payment.<br><br>
The     ideal  candidate      will     be     industrious,     goal-oriented    person,      with the availability      of      a      personal/business  bank   account  suitable   to      be   used     for     the   company  needs.    Knowledge       of  English,     computer     literacy       and    sociability      are      appreciated.<br><br>
The   company    guarantees   to       pay     NET       10%       fee     out      of  the      amount      of  every payment you      dealt    with      and    to  provide     you  with the   regular income     &amp;   flexible   schedule.    All  the    related  expenses       you       might   have (like      the     Western     Union/Money Gram    chargers,  related   expenses       on      traveling) are       covered   by   the   company.<br><br>
