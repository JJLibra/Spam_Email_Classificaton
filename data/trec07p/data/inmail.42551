Dear Friend,


I am a citizen of switzerland  temporarily living and working in Standard
Chartered Bank ,Hong Kong.


I have a proposal to discuss about a late Client of mine who I think is
co-incidentally related to you, on fixed

deposit in my bank.


Please contact me for further information about this business.


Thank you.
Mr George Blueman.
