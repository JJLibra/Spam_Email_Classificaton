<P><FONT face=3D"Courier New" color=3Dblack size=3D2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling bored?&nbsp; If so, that could mean that you=
r brain is &quot;hungry.&quot;&nbsp; Did you know that you can &quot;feed&qu=
ot; and keep your brain in shape, just like you can with your body?&nbsp; I'=
ve just been reading about what seems to be a growing movement to encourage =
people to do mental aerobics, or exercise for the brain.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the body, your brain needs stimulation,=
 or exercise, to keep its cells active and efficient.&nbsp; It's rather like=
 the old saying, &quot;use it or lose it.&quot;&nbsp; And it isn't only elde=
rly people who may be concerned about such things as memory loss.&nbsp; Acco=
rding to Dr. Gary Small, the director of the Center on Ageing at the Univers=
ity of California, brain &quot;ageing&quot; can occur in people in their twe=
nties or thirties.&nbsp; Evidently genetics plays a part in brain ageing, bu=
t only by about a third.&nbsp; The other two-thirds has to do with our envir=
onment and lifestyle choices.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time you're feeling bored or perhaps les=
s than alert, why not try a little mental exercise to sharpen up those brain=
 cells?&nbsp; I've started to collect some exercises, and here are just a fe=
w suggestions:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Try counting backwards from 100 to zero as fast as you can.
<br>Pick a letter from the alphabet and name 20 words that start with it as =
quickly as you can.
<br>Recite the names of all the teachers you've ever had.
<br>Switch to the other hand to do tasks.&nbsp; For example, if you are righ=
t-handed, use your left hand, and vice versa.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of my favorites is &#150; wiggle your toe=
s!&nbsp; This is a good way to &quot;wake up&quot; your brain in the morning=
.&nbsp; While you're still in bed, slowly begin to move your toes, wiggling,=
 scrunching and stretching them.&nbsp; Move them up and down, and then try j=
ust moving your big toes.&nbsp; This actually activates nerves that stimulat=
e your brain.&nbsp; You can also do this if you've been sitting a while; it =
will help you become more alert.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Memo, put your mind to it!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practical considerations are important if you are wo=
rking out a problem.  Others may offer to help.  If you need their skills, I=
 suggest that you accept the offer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't be surprised if you are surprised today my fri=
end, since a very unpredictable energy seems to be pulsing throughout the da=
y.  Do whatever feels healthy and liberating to you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be time to pay the piper, my dear, and the pi=
per is likely to collect.  Keep your nose out of other people's business tod=
ay, especially where your work or daily responsibilities are concerned.
