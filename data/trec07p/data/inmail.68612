Dear Sir or Madam
   
  Good day and how are you today? I hope fine? ,Permit me to inform you of my desire of asking you to be a guardian or foster parent to me and then help me out in what i am about to tell you. I'm NORA JACOB (17) and the only child of Late Mr. & Mrs.CISSE JACOB. My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant here in Abidjan, the economic capital of Cote D'Ivoire. He was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outings on a business trip. My mother died when i was a baby.
   
   Before the death of my father on Sept. 2006 in a private hospital here in Abidjan, he secretly called me by his bed side and told me that he has the sum of Nine Million Two Hundred thousand United States Dollars USD ($9.200,000) deposited in a suspense account in one of the big bank here in Abidjan. He told me that he used my name (NORA) as the next of Kin to deposit the money. He then strongly advised me NOT to seek for assistance in the investment of the money from his lawyer nor any of his friend here but to seek for a foreign partner from any country of my choice (outside my country,Cote D'Ivoire) that will assist me in the wise investment of the money.I have since left the money in the bank with the view of making use of it for investment purposes after my educational carrier. But as you may be already aware by now, my country (Cote D'Ivoire) is presently at war caused by political crises.
   
   Rebels have already taken over the whole Northern part of the country and making efforts towards the capture of the commercial center of the country,Abidjan, where i am now. For this urgly development in this country,I have now decided to take quick actions and have this money transferred out of this country before it is too late.I now want to transfer it out and use it for investment purpose like real estate management or hotel management Because of this i am honorably seeking your assistance in the following ways.
   
  (1) To be my guardian and then assist me financialy to transfer the money into your bank account.
(2) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further my education and then settle there parmanently.
   
  If you accept to stand as my guardian or foster parent, we need not to discuss on any percentage with you as you have to see the whole money as yours and then assist me invest it. But if you still want a percentage, I am willing to offer you,15 % of the total money as compensation for your assistance. Please let me know if you feel the percentage i offered is not ok by you.As soon as i recieve your full assurance and corporation,I will then give you the bank contact information and then tell them to transfer the money into your account as i want to come over to stay with you parmanently. You shall then be giving me information on when the transfer will be over.I shall also send my picture to you and shall also need yours too. No matter what your decision may turn out to be, please i beg you to  
   
  reply to my strictly on my private email address:
   
  Thanks and God bless you  

  Best regards, 

  Miss Nora Jacob
