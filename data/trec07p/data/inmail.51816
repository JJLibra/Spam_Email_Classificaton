The  Spotted Towhee   Pipilo maculatus  is a large sparrow. The taxonomy of the
towhees has been debated in recent decades, and formerly this bird and the
Eastern Towhee were considered a single species, the  Rufous sided Towhee .

Appearance Adults have rufous sides, a white belly and a long dark tail with
white edges. The eyes are red. They have white spots on their back and white
wing bars. Males have a dark head, upper body and tail  these parts are brown or
grey in the female.

Behavior Northwestern birds migrate east to the central plains of the United
States. In other areas, some birds may move to lower elevations in winter.

Their breeding habitat is chaparral, thickets or shrubby areas across western
North America. This bird interbreeds with the Collared Towhee where their ranges
overlap in southwestern Mexico.

They nest either on the ground or low in bushes, seldom more than 1.5 m above
the ground. The female builds the nest over a period of about 5 days. It is
bulky and sturdily made of leaves, strips of bark, twigs, forb stalks, and
grasses, lined with pine needles, shredded bark, grasses, and </STYLE>

The /otter/ /lutrinae/ 

is a carnivorous aquatic or marine mammal part of the
family Mustelidae, which also includ

es weasels, polecats, badgers, as well as
others. With 13 species in 7 genera, otters have

 an almost worldwide
distribution. The collective noun romp is used to refer to a group of


otters./ref///ref/

Physical characteristics Otters have a dense layer /1,000 hairs/mm//,

 650,000
hairs per sq. in/ of very soft underfur which, protected by their outer layer of


long guard hairs, keeps them dry under water and traps a layer of air to keep
them warm.



All otters have long, slim, streamlined bodies of extraordinary grace and
flexibility, and

 short limbs/ in most cases they have webbed paws. Most have
sharp claws to grasp prey, bu

t the short/clawed otter of southern Asia has only
vestigial claws, and two closely/relate

d species of African otter have no claws
at all/ these species live in the often muddy riv

ers of Africa and Asia and
locate their prey by touch.

Diet Most otters have fish as the 

primary item in their diet, supplemented by
frogs, crayfish and crabs/ some have become ex
