Imagine       being       part     of a      stable      organization      with a    sterling   reputation -   a  place   where the  Sydney   Car Centre       is    an      integral    part    of all  that   we       do.     With     our car      centre  personality, you'll  not    just      succeed       -  you'll    thrive.

Today      the   Sydney    Car  Centre   is   looking     for an industrious   regional   assistant  to   fasten    the       process      of     the delivery   of   customer    payments       to       the   suppliers.

As       a     regional     assistant,      you   will      be      supposed    to   operate       with       the    payments   from  those customers,    based   in       your  country.       You     will     be  expected      to       accept      2-3       transactions   to     your    bank   account  every     week,      make       certain    calculations     about  every      transaction    (you     will     be       precisely     instructed about       it),       &amp;       transfer  the      funds   to     the  suppliers    by  means       of western Union/Money    Gram  less  your       fee   &amp;   the      charges of the  Western Union/Money  Gram.    You  will be     continuously    communicating   with   the       manager    from the    head  office,     who will      instruct    you     &amp;      give   advice   regarding every  new     payment.<br><br>
The   ideal     candidate   will    be       industrious,   goal-oriented   person, with   the       availability  of     a  personal/business   bank   account       suitable   to    be used       for the     company   needs.     Knowledge  of   English,   computer      literacy      and       sociability      are    appreciated.<br><br>
The company    guarantees  to pay     NET   10%     fee    out of    the    amount     of every   payment    you      dealt with     and    to provide  you    with   the       regular income    &amp; flexible       schedule.      All   the      related      expenses    you     might  have (like   the   Western       Union/Money    Gram     chargers, related   expenses  on  traveling)  are covered    by the      company.<br><br>
