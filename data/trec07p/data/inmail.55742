Dear valued member.
It’s your therapist’s assistant writing to you. I just wanted to give you some really useful advice on how to shop for drugs online.
There are so many online drugstores on the Web today – but not all of them are as reliable as one might want them to be. Actually, only a few of them (for example, USDrugs) sell 100% generic meds – so you have to be really careful while choosing where to buy your pills.
Hope that you take our advice seriously. Take care.
