Ave, my dear friend

You know, it seems to me that during the last period of time our rare letters don't bring enough information and
topics for discussion and it seems to me that this bothers us to continue usual communication and don't give us a
chance to become more open for each other. Did you get such a feeling? It's strange. Relations begin and then somehow
they go to nowhere, just disappear. Of course I understand that maybe this is the influence of differences we have
between us, but on the other hand I think that difference of language and culture is not the most terrible thing,
maybe this can make relations even more interesting? How do you think?
Is this possible that two adult people who were attracted to each other from the very beginning suddenly have no
things to discuss? I believe that everybody's personality has many different sides and there will never be enough of
time to explore it completely. I've even thought that maybe this need to write letters really pushes at us and don't
give us enough of free space, because it's really difficult to explain with words what you can show with your eyes and
mimics sometimes. Do you agree?
So, I will wait for your reply. I know that maybe my thoughts will seem strange to you, but somehow I begun to think
about this and I would like to know if there is any chance to change this for better and to continue learning each
other without any pressure, I mean without feeling that you write because you have to reply and not because you want.

Sweet goodbye
