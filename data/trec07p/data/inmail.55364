The basic drafting skills are stillthis is that and that 
ispossiblefor us becasue i say thins forall tof the guys
required, yet curriculums are now being augmented with courses
dealing with computer-aided design.  The field of  graphic design
is also changing rapidly. The majority of advertisement, logos,
letterheads and all types of signage are now all being produced
on computers.  It is not only the design fields themselves that
it should be considered and artistic field or not.  On a distorted road, my feet are getting shaky but not my heart. 
I have nothing to give to Mia. My pockets are almost empty. But my heart is filled with love. I will give Mia the pleasure.
 A pleasure that would reflect on her face. I will get her back her long lost shining eyes, her smiles, her vigor, her innocence, 
her childish mischief, everything.I enter the house. Mia is busy washing clothes. I grab her from her shoulders and make her 
stand right in front of me so close that we feel our breaths hitting our faces, our hearts listen to each other's beats, or
 eyes play with together, and I, taking her hands into mine, thrust our fingers together.
I could easily tell my friends that I have married a riddle. But it wasn't her; it was the system and the atmosphere in which we lived. In such a breath-hindering air, she was not only living alive but was keeping me alive as well. She had kept alive that precious feeling of love that had died in us. To remain alive in such a breathless air, she needed me and I desired her. That's why I never got tired of her strange acts. I couldn't leave her alone. If I had left her alone, I would have become alone as well.
Then one day, this system left me no option but to hate it and stand up in revolt against it. Mia was pregnant. She was facing a delivery situation. I rented a car to take her to hospital. We were both delighted. Everything looked fresh and new again. I hadn't yet reached the main road when two policemen stopped me. They told me that I couldn't go ahead. On my humble inquiry they told me that a member of the Politburo was to travel through this road so the passage was closed for general public. I informed them of my irresistible compulsion but they were earless. Justice is deaf in our part of the world. In response to my pleads, however, they had mercy on me enough to guide me to an alternate passage yet at the same time informed me that the road was under construction.
I considered it a blessing and turned the vehicle towards the alternative.
That road was like highway to hell, There were
many painters who had trained for years to be able to replicate a
tree realistically on canvas  who were dismayed at the idea that
photography was to be taken seriously as an art form. The majority of advertisement, logos,

time, as the consternation of a new and unknown field wore of f,
and with computers is different than it was twenty years ago.  
The world is now linked electronically and we have become one
affected the fields of Cybernetics, Virtual Reality, artificial
life, and computer design programs.  The transformation that can
be seen in the Art world is astronomical and has irrevocally
changed the way in which society views and values visual art.  
The technological progression over the last hundred years have
It`s funny how we`re living in the past so much of the time. 
The present, for me, has not just one finite meaning.  We all
tradition? and a walking tour of Market Square, Fantan Alley,
and Chinatown - but no points allowed for that one.  Eleanor
Grant from Comox is now going up to receive a certificated for
context.  Often, making THINGS interesting is part of what
everything we construct is about.  We are here, alive, so why not
think about stuff & talk about stuff & write about stuff and do
it and make it interesting while we`re here.  Enlightenment is
boring, so balanced and harmonious and uninteresting.  There you
have it, the answer to IT all.  So now what, you`re alive, what
else is new.  Just keep on living & working or what ever I
suppose.  N`est-ce pas?  And change too I guess.  Throw that in
there as well.  Change or not comes from growth or rather can
be growth, and if you like expanding your mind and being lets
say you learn form experiences and as a result change or not
I seem to be getting sidetracked something which I like a bit
too much perhaps.  Or maybe there is just so much I want to say
that I get on to something else before I clearly and neatly
finish up with what I oh what ever.  An outline and maybe some
more formal structure to this speel would make it more acceptable
at least used to looking at creativity in such a way.  Normally
when ever I write it is not about things which are as of yet
undefined.  This means that I am writing about nothing which is
now becoming something.  As well as controlling day to day concerns,
the personal computer will have capabilities of obtaining vast
amounts of information on any subject.  I can see most homes
running in conjunction with the super information highways of the
future.  Connection to any info library or satellite link-ups
could all be performed through the average home based personal
computer.  The vast amounts of information that will be available
to every person at any time may be overwhelming. It may reach the
point to where people will never haveThis is just how technologies and
cultural movements are continually emerging, evolving, and being
defined.  I can write about what is now happening in my world, as
far as I know, and what I am doing within it, as a part of it so
to speak.  Often the more one knows the more one can partake. 
But not always.  For example, I can partake with what I know, but
of course not everywhere, well yes everywhere.  



My chosen field is the arts. More specifically the graphic arts.
