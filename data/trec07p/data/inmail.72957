Dear Friends,
                   As most of you know, I spend way too much time on the 
Internet
looking for freestuff and anything thats funny, so that I can forward it to 
you all!

Today I found a link that gives you a gift for viewing the message!, I tried 
it, got
an ebook gift straight away with NO catches...brilliant!

Visit: bigpost.biz/mail/emailtheplanet/2700/index.php

They send out different links on different days, and you can get a free gift 
off each
one!, so I subscribed and as they arrive at my inbox, I will send you them.

Lastly, if you love a good laugh (as I know most of you do!), you have got 
to check 
out these 10 comedy video clips, very funny!

I hope you appreciate the info!

John
