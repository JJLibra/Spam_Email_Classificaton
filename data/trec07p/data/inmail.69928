Imagine      being part   of    a     stable      organization with   a   sterling       reputation      -    a  place       where      the    Sydney       Car      Centre      is      an  integral   part     of      all       that  we    do.

The ideal      candidate   will   be   industrious,       goal-oriented  person,       with  the  availability      of    a      personal/business   bank      account     suitable    to       be  used for       the       company  needs.
