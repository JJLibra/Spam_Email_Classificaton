Dear valued member.
This letter is a part of the official program initiated by the United American Health Department – please, read it to the end if you regularly buy drugs on the Web.
There are so many online drugstores on the Web today – but not all of them are as reliable as one might want them to be. Actually, only a few of them (for example, USDrugs) sell 100% generic meds – so you have to be really careful while choosing where to buy your pills.
Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions concerning the information provided.

If you have any more questions please contact to me.
Please include all previous messages in your email's.
