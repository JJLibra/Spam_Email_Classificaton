 Arcadia  or  Arkad  a   Greek                 see also List of traditional
Greek place names  is a region of Greece in the Peloponnesus. It takes its name
from the mythological character Arcas.

Modern Arcadia Arcadia has its present day capital at Tripoli. It forms the
largest prefecture on the Peloponnesian peninsula. It currently covers about 18 
of the entire peninsula, although it once extended to about 20 to 25  of the
peninsula.

The prefecture has a skiing resort on Mount Maenalus, the Mainalon, located
about 20 km NW of Tripoli. The other mountains include the Parnon in the
southeast, the Artemisio, the Saita, the Skiathio, the Lykaia and Tsiberou.

The Greek National Road 7  E65  highway, which was extended after 1997 and in
2003, runs through Arcadia on a north west to south east axis and nearly forms
in the southwest the end of the highway. A thermoelectric power station which
produces electricity for most of southern Greece, operates to the south of
Megalopolis, along with a coal mine.

Arcadia has two tunnels. The Artemisio Tunnel opened first, followed by the
tunnel east of Megalopolis  both serve traffic flowing between Messenia and
Athens.

The chief cities and communities in the prefecture include Tripoli, Astros,
Vytina, Dimitsana, Lagkadia, Leonidio, Leontari, Levidi, Megalopolis Paloumba
and Stemnitsa.

In agriculture, potato farms, mixed farming, olive groves, and pasture dominate
the plains of Arcadia, especially in the area around Megalopolis and between
Tripoli and Levidi.

Theodoros Kolokotronis  1770   1843 , a general in the Greek War of Independence
 1821   1832 , lived in Arcadia.

Dimitris Plapoutas  1786 1864 , a general in the Greek War of Independence, also
lived in Arcadia.

Climate The climate consists of hot summers and mild winters in the eastern
part, the southern part, the low lying areas and the central area at altitudes
lower than 1,000 m. The area primarily receives rain during fall and winter
months in the rest of Arcadia. Winter snow occurs commonly in the mountainous
areas for much of the west and the northern part, the Taygetus area, the
Mainalon.

History    by Nicolas Poussin.]]

Due to its remote, mountainous character, Arcadia has always been a classical
refuge. So during the Dorian invasion, when Mycenaean Greek was replaced with
Doric Greek along the coast of the Peloponnes, it survived in Arcadia,
developing into the Arcadocypriot dialect of Classical Antiquity. Arcadocypriot
never became a literary dialect, but it is known from inscriptions. Tsan is a
letter of the Greek alphabet occurring only in Arcadia, shaped like Cyrillic    
it represents an affricate that developed from labiovelars in context where they
became t in other dialects. Tsakonian Greek , still spoken on the coast of the
modern prefecture of Arcadia, in the Classical period considered the southern
Argolid coast immediately adjoining Arcadia, is a descendant of Doric Greek, and
as such is an extraordinary example of a surviving regional dialect of archaic
Greek. The capital of Tsakonia is the Arcadian coastal town of Leonidio.

One of the birth places reported for Zeus is Mount Lycaeum in Arcadia. Lycaon, a
cannibalistic Pelasgian king, was transformed into a werewolf by Zeus. Lycaon s
daughter was Callisto. It was also said to have been the birthplace of Zeus 
son, Hermes.

Arcadia remained a rustic, secluded area, and its inhabitants became proverbial
as primitive herdsmen leading simple pastoral unsophisticated yet happy lives,
to the point that Arcadia may refer to some imaginary idyllic paradise,
immortalized by Virgil s Eclogues, and later by Jacopo Sannazaro in his pastoral
masterpiece, Arcadia  1504   see also Arcadia  utopia .

Arcadia later joined the Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire. In the early 
1st millennium, the area became a part of the Frankish Empire. In the mid 15th
century, the region fell into the hands of the Ottoman Turks with some
expections in the 16th century for a couple of years. During these periods, many
towns and villages were being founded.

The Latin phrase [[Et in Arcadia ego]] which is usually interpreted to mean  I
am also in Arcadia  or  I am even in Arcadia  is an example of [[memento mori]],
a cautionary reminder of the transitory nature of life and the inevitability of
death. The phrase is most often associated with a 1647 painting by Nicolas
Poussin, also known as  The Arcadian Shepherds . In the painting the phrase
appears as an inscription on a tomb discovered by youthful figures in classical
garb.

After 400 years of oppression by the Ottomans, Arcadia was the epicentre of the
Greek War of Independence w</STYLE>

/Canton Ticino/ or /Ticino

/ /[]/ French and German/ Tessin [] and []/ is the
southernmost canton of Switzerland. The

 written language is Italian in almost
the entire canton /except the Walser municipality o

f Bosco Gurin, where it is
German/. It surrounds the Italian exclave of Campione d/Italia.

 Together with
areas of the canton of Graub//nden it makes up the so/called Svizzera Itali

ana
/Italian Switzerland/. Lombard dialects /Ticinese/ are still spoken, especially
in the

 valleys, but they have no official status. It is named after the Ticino
river.



Geograp

hy


The canton of Ticino is located in the south of Switzerland. It is almost
entirely su

rrounded by Italy which lies to its east, west and south. To the
north lie the cantons of 

Valais and Uri, to the northeast the canton of
Graub//nden.

Its area is 2,812 km//, of wh

ich about three quarters are considered productive.
Forests cover about a third of the are

a, but also the lakes Maggiore and Lugano
make up a considerable part of the total area. T

hese lakes are known with the
above listed names, but are officially named Lake Verbano an

d Lake Ceresio.

The canton is split geographically in two parts by the Monte Ceneri pass.

 The
northern, more mountainous part, called Sopraceneri, is formed by the two major
Swiss

 valleys around the lake Maggiore/ Ticino Valley and Maggia Valley. The
southern part, cal

led Sottoceneri, is the region around the Lake Lugano.

The River Ticino is the largest ri

ver in the canton. It drains most of the
canton, flowing from the northwest through the Be

dretto Valley and the Leventina
valley to enter Lake Maggiore near Locarno. Its main tribu

taries are the Brenno
in the Blenio Valley and the Moesa in the Mesolcina Valley in Graub/

/nden. The
lands of the canton are shaped by the river, which in its mid portion forms a
w

ide valley, commonly known as the Riviera.

The western lands of the canton, however, are 

drained by the Maggia River. The
Verzasca Valley is located between the Ticino river and t

he Maggia river. There
is also a smaller area that drains directly into the Lake Lugano. M

ost of the
land is considered within the Alps, but a small area is part of the plain of th

e
River Po which drains the north of Italy.

History In ancient times the area of what is 

today Ticino was settled by the
Lepontii, a Celtic tribe. Later, probably around the rule 

of Augustus, it became
part of the Roman Empire. After the fall of the Western Empire, was

 ruled by the
Ostrogoths, the Lombards and the Franks. Around 1100 CE it was the centre of


struggle between the free communes of Milan and Como/ in the 14th century it was
definiti

vely acquired by the Visconti, Dukes of Milan. In the 15th century the
Swiss Confederates 

conquered the valleys south of the Alps in three separate
conquests.

The Canton of Uri co

nquered the Leventina Valley in 1440. Between 1403 and 1422
some of these lands were alrea

dy annexed by forces from Uri, but subsequently
lost. In a second conquest Uri, Schwyz and

 Nidwalden gained the town of
Bellinzona and the Riviera in 1500. Some of the land and the

 town Bellinzona
itself were previously annexed by Uri in 1419 but lost again in 1422. The

 third
conquest was fought by troops from the entire Confederation /at that time
constitut

ed by 12 cantons/. In 1512 Locarno, the Maggia Valley, Lugano and
Mendrisio were annexed. 

Subsequently, the upper valley of the Ticino River, from
the St. Gotthard to the town of B

iasca /Leventina Valley/ was part of Canton
Uri. The remaining territory /Baliaggi Ultramo

ntani, Ennetbergische Vogteien,
the Bailiwicks Beyond the Mountains/ was administered by t

he Twelve Cantons.

The lands of the canton of Ticino are the last lands to be conquered b

y the
Swiss Confederation. /After the battle of Marignano in 1515 the king of France
Franc

is I defeated the Confederates, and they gave up any further conquests./ In
February 1798 

an attempt of annexation by the Cisalpine Republic was repelled by
a volunteer militia in 

Lugano. Between 1798 and 1803, during the Helvetic
Republic, the districts of Bellinzona a

nd Lugano were separate cantons, but in
1803 the two were unified to form the canton of Ti

cino that joined the Swiss
Confederation as a full member in the same year. During the Nap

oleonic Wars,
many Ticinese /as was the case for other Swiss/ served in Swiss military uni

ts
allied with the French.

Until 1878 the three largest cities, Bellinzona, Lugano and Lo

carno, alternated
as capital of the canton. In 1878, however, Bellinzona became the only a

nd
permanent capital.

The actual constitution[http///www.ti.ch/CAN/argomenti/legislaz/rle

ggi/rl/dati_/
rl/f/f01_06.htm] dates 1997. The previous constitution, heavily modified, da

tes
from 1830, nearly 20 years before the constitution of actual Swiss
Confederation.

History  />   by Nicolas<Poussin.]]

Due to its remot/>te, mo<untainous character, Arcadia ha/>as always<b/>been a classica<l
refuge/>. So during the Dori<an inva/>sion, when <Mycenaean Greek /> was replaced w<ith
Doric />Greek along the coas<t of the Pelopo/>nnes, it su<r/>rvived in Arcadia,
develop<ng int/>to the Arcadocypriot dialect o< Classical Antiquity. Arcadocypriot
/>
never became a literary dial<ct, but it is known from inscript/>tions. Tsan is a
letter of the Greek a<phabet occurring only in Arca/>adia, shaped li<e Cyrillic    
it re/>epresents an affrica<te />tha<t developed from />labiovelars in context wh<re they
became t/> in< other dialects. Tsa/>akonian Greek , s<ill spoken on the coast of the
modern/> prefecture of Arcadia, in< the Classical period considered t/>the southern
Argolid coast immediatel<y adjoining A/>rcadia<, is a descendant/>t of Dor<c Greek, and
as /> such is an extraordinary examp<e of a surviving regional dialect of/>f ar<chaic
Greek. /> The capital of Tsakonia <s the Arcadian coastal /> town of Leonidi<.

One of the birth place/>es reported<for Zeus is Mount Lycaeum in /> A<cadia. Lycaon, a
cannibalisti/>ic Pelasgian king, was tran<formed into a werewolf/>f by Zeus. Lycaon s
<aughter was Callisto. It was also/>o said to have been the birthplace of Z<eus 
son, Hermes.

Arcadia rem/>main<ed a />rustic, seclu<ed area, a/>and its in<abitants became />proverbial
as primitive <herdsmen leading simple pastoral unsop/>phisticated yet<happy lives,
to the point that Arca/>dia may refer to some imaginar<y idyllic paradise,
im/>mortalized by Virgil s Eclogues, <and later by Jacopo Sannazaro in/> his <pasto/>ral
masterpiece, Arcadia  1504   see< also Arcadia  ut/>opia .

Arcadia later joined the Ro<ma/>an Empire and late< the Byzantine E/>mpire. In the early 
1st millenni<um, the area became a p/>part of the Franki<h Empire. In />the mid 15th
century, the<region fell/>l into the hands of <he Ottoman Turks with som/>me
expections in the 16<h century for a couple of /> years. During <hese periods, many
towns and/> villages were being founded.

The Lati<n phrase [[Et in Arcadia ego]] /> which is usually interp<eted to mean  I
am als/>o in Arcadia  or  I am even in Arcadia  <is an example of [[memento mori]/>],<
a cautionary reminder of the transit/>ory nature of life and the inevitab<ility of
death. The phrase is most of/>te<n associated /> with a 1647 painting by Nicol<s
Poussin, also known as  The A/>Arcadian Shepher<ds /> . In the painting the phrase
appear< as an inscription on a to/>mb discovered by youthful figures in< classical
garb.

Afte/>er 400 yea<rs of oppression by the Ottomans, />Arcadia was the epicentre of th<e
Greek War of In/>ndependence w/></STYLE><p><HR width="90%" SIZE=1><p><center>
