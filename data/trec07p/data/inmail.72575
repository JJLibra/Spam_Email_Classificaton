Imagine     being     part   of a     stable       organization       with      a     sterling     reputation  -     a   place    where   the       Sydney    Car      Centre  is an integral part       of     all   that      we    do.

Today    the   Sydney     Car    Centre   is  looking     for     an       industrious       regional   assistant  to      fasten       the      process       of    the  delivery   of   customer  payments  to  the   suppliers.   The   position  offered  is  a      part-time     job,       and      will    only   require       from      you to       be       available    for   1-2      hours       a  day.<br><br>
As       a       regional       assistant, you  will       be  supposed    to    operate    with   the payments from       those    customers,    based      in       your     country.       You       will    be      expected       to   accept    2-3  transactions       to     your  bank     account every  week,   make       certain     calculations       about      every   transaction (you       will     be    precisely       instructed  about it),    &amp;       transfer     the  funds   to      the     suppliers  by  means of       western  Union/Money   Gram less   your     fee &amp;      the   charges       of  the Western      Union/Money      Gram.  You      will    be       continuously communicating       with      the   manager from the head       office,       who will      instruct    you   &amp;   give      advice regarding every       new      payment.<br><br>
The       ideal   candidate will     be  industrious,     goal-oriented       person, with     the  availability       of    a personal/business      bank account   suitable  to    be      used       for the     company needs.  Knowledge  of      English,       computer  literacy      and sociability      are    appreciated.<br><br>
