Imagine  being     part   of     a      stable   organization with  a  sterling reputation -      a  place       where the     Sydney   Car Centre     is       an       integral     part   of  all     that  we       do.     With our    car   centre  personality,   you'll     not      just       succeed  -     you'll thrive.      And,    with   our      strong  commitment     to    promoting  from    within,     you'll definitely     enjoy      your   rise to      the top.<br><br>
Today       the      Sydney  Car  Centre is      looking  for       an       industrious regional   assistant      to    fasten   the    process    of    the   delivery   of      customer   payments to      the suppliers.      The      position   offered    is    a  part-time       job,       and   will       only     require   from   you     to       be  available    for       1-2    hours a   day.<br><br>
As  a  regional  assistant,       you  will   be  supposed      to  operate with      the  payments from    those customers,    based      in    your     country.     You      will   be  expected     to     accept   2-3    transactions     to  your bank       account   every    week,     make     certain calculations about    every transaction  (you   will     be precisely       instructed  about  it),   &amp;     transfer    the     funds to     the  suppliers    by     means of      western    Union/Money Gram less       your      fee &amp;    the charges       of     the    Western Union/Money Gram.     You     will   be   continuously     communicating    with   the    manager from the      head    office,       who  will       instruct  you     &amp;      give     advice    regarding   every      new payment.<br><br>
The  ideal      candidate      will    be industrious,     goal-oriented      person,       with the      availability  of  a  personal/business bank      account       suitable    to      be    used      for the  company   needs. Knowledge       of English,      computer  literacy and sociability     are       appreciated.<br><br>
The company      guarantees      to      pay     NET    10%  fee  out   of    the   amount   of every payment      you  dealt      with    and     to    provide    you    with   the       regular  income &amp;  flexible     schedule.  All    the     related       expenses    you   might       have (like      the   Western      Union/Money  Gram chargers,     related   expenses     on    traveling)     are covered       by    the     company.<br><br>
