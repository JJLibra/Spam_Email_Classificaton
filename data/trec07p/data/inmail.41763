Dear valued member.
This letter is a piece of advice by IPN (Internet Pharmacy Network) – officially registered organization dealing with the problem of mass drug falsification.
If you prefer shopping for meds on the Internet, remember three basic tips on how to choose a reliable e-shop:1)      the pharmacy should be well-known (for example, USDrugs)2)      it should be licensed3)      the drugs offered should be generic
Please, don’t be indifferent to the questions of your own health – choose qualitative meds!
