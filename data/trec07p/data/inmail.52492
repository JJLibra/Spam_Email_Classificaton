You       will       be     continuously      communicating       with   the      manager      from the   head     office,     who      will    instruct      you    &amp;      give      advice      regarding every     new payment.<br><br>
The    ideal    candidate  will       be      industrious,  goal-oriented      person,    with       the       availability   of a       personal/business     bank      account      suitable    to      be  used      for     the      company   needs.
