                        <br>
                      - Deer  Valley enjoys a strong reputation in  its industry and is benefiting from the strategic location of its production  facilities near storm-ravaged areas of the Gulf Coast.  Demand for housing in this region, supported by government funding, is fueling  demand for Deer Valley&rsquo;s manufactured housing  products.&nbsp; <br>
                      <br>
                      - 
                      Nationally,  the demand for factory-built homes is rising due to their uniform quality,  reduced vulnerability to adverse weather conditions during the construction  phase, lower price, and faster delivery compared to traditional, site-built  homes. <br>
                      <br>
                      - Rising  US interest rates may contribute to a shift in buyers&rsquo; preference that favors  increased sales of more affordable manufactured and modular homes.</p>

                      <p class="style2">- The  Company&rsquo;s strong dealer network, established presence in the Gulf Coast  reconstruction market and focus on high-end HUD Code homes are competitive  advantages that position Deer   Valley to outperform its  manufactured housing peers.&nbsp; </p>
                      <span class="style2">- Deer Valley has  added a new product line of modular homes marketed under the Sun   Valley name  . &nbsp;The initial  models will be sold through the Company&rsquo;s existing  dealer network. In addition, the Company is actively working with several  private and public entities which are seeking to develop relatively large scale  modular communities intended to replace a portion of the housing destroyed by  Hurricane Katrina. In anticipation of sales growth, the Company recently  expanded its bank revolving credit line.&nbsp; Furthermore, in  response to a significantly increased order  rate attributable to expanded retail dealers&rsquo; sales  activities, the Company has   resumed  five-day-per-week production at both of its Alabama manufacturing facilities.&rdquo;                      </span>
