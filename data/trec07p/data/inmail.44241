Dear valued member.
We are writing to inform you about the result of the recent research concerning the quality of the drugs sold on the Internet.
This letter is NOT a piece of ad – we just want you to know that more 80% of the drugs you purchase on the Internet come from underground factories in southern Asia – so, apparently, no one can say that they are totally safe. The only drugstore that has managed to prove the quality of its meds so far is USDrugs.
Take care of your health – use generic drugs from licensed manufacturers and providers only!

If you have any more questions please contact to me.
