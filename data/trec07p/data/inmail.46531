Dear Winner,

         LOTTO RHEINLAND-PFALZ WIN NOTIFICATION

We are pleased to inform you of the result of the just concluded
annual final draws of the LOTTO Rheinland-Pfalz Program. LOTTO
Rheinland-Pfalz draws was conducted from an exclusive list of
25,000,000 e-mail addresses of individual and corporate bodies
picked  by an advanced automated random computer ballot search from
the internet as part of our international promotions program which
we conduct every year. No tickets were sold.

After this automated computer ballot, your e-mail address attached
to serial number 76-2006 drew the lucky numbers 3-24-1-10-49-17
which consequently emerged you as one of first fifty (50) lucky
winners in this category.

You have therefore been approved for a lump sum payout of
EUR 1,000,000.00 (One Million EURO) in cash credited to file LRP/19-DE/
9317. This is from a total cash prize of &#8364;50,000,000 (Fifty
Million) Euro shared amongst the first fifty (50) lucky winners in
this category.

This year Lottery Program Jackpot is the largest ever for LOTTO
Rheinland-Pfalz. The estimated &#8364;50 million jackpot would be the
sixth-biggest in Europe history. The biggest was the &#8364;363
million jackpot that went to two winners in a Febuary 2000 drawing
of The Big Game Mega Millions' predecessor.

Your fund is now deposited in an offshore bank with a hardcover
insurance. Due to the mix up of some numbers and names, we advice
that you keep this award from public notice until your claim has
been processed and your money remitted to you as this is part of
our security protocol to avoid double claiming or unwarranted
taking advantage of this program by the general public.

Please note that your lucky winning number falls within our
European booklet representative office in London. In view of this,
your &#8364;1,000,000.00 (One Million Euro) would be released to you
by our affiliate bank in Europe. Our agent will immediately
commence the process to facilitate the release of your funds to you
as soon as you make contact with him.
