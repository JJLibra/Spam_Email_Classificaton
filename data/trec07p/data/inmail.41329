<=21--WASHINGTON - A bipartisan immigration deal that would grant legal status to millio=
ns of people in the country unlawfully is drawing criticism from across the political spec=
trum.=20

ADVERTISEMENT
=20
The bargain reached between key Democratic and Republican senators and the White House fa=
ces an uncertain future in the Senate, which is set to begin debating it Monday.

=22I don't know if the immigration legislation is going to bear fruit and we're going to be a=
ble to pass it,=22 said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (news, bio, voting record), D-Ne=
v., who harbored =22serious concerns=22 about the deal.

Even if it were to survive what's certain to be a searing Senate battle, the measure would be=
 up against long odds in the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (news, bio, voting record), D-Cali=
f., acknowledging deep divisions on immigration among Democrats, says she won't bring it=
 up unless        President Bush can guarantee he will produce 70 Republican backers =E2=80=
=94 a tall order given GOP concerns that the bill is too lenient.

The agreement, which also mandates tougher border security and workplace enforcement, m=
arked an extraordinary marriage of liberal and conservative goals that has the potential=
 to bridge stubborn divides and ensure enactment of new laws this year.

Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., his party's lead negotiator on the deal, called it an exam=
ple of the =22politics of the possible,=22 while conservative Sen. Jon Kyl (news, bio, vot=
ing record), R-Ariz., said it was the =22best opportunity=22 for a bipartisan solution to=
 the nation's immigration problems.

It was soon under attack, however, from a set of lawmakers and interest groups as diverse as=
 those that united to craft it. Their varying concerns and competing agendas =E2=80=
=94 along with a challenging political environment =E2=80=94 could be enough to unravel t=
he painstakingly written agreement.

Two of the key players in the talks from each end of the political spectrum, Sen. Robert Mene=
ndez (news, bio, voting record), D-N.J., and Sen. John Cornyn (news, bio, voting record),=
 R-Texas, walked away from the deal before it was announced.

Conservatives branded it =22amnesty,=22 complaining that it would reward the nation's e=
stimated 12 million illegal immigrants with a way of gaining legal status and staying in th=
e U.S. permanently without being punished.

=22What part of illegal does the Senate not understand? Any plan that rewards illegal beha=
vior is amnesty,=22 said Rep. Brian Bilbray (news, bio, voting record), R-Calif., chairm=
an of the Immigration Reform Caucus.

The deal would allow illegal immigrants to come forward right away, but they could not get v=
isas or begin a path to citizenship until the border security improvements and a high-tech=
 worker identification program were in place.

After that, illegal immigrants could obtain a renewable =22Z visa=22 that would allow the=
m stay in the country indefinitely. After paying fees and fines totaling =245,000, they co=
uld ultimately get on track for permanent residency, which could take between eight and 13=
 years. Heads of households would have to return to their home countries first.

Liberals, on the other hand, are unhappy with the proposal because it makes a far-reaching=
 change in the immigration system that would admit future arrivals seeking to put down root=
s in the U.S. based on their skills, education levels and job experience =E2=80=94 limitin=
g the importance of family ties.

=22We have concerns about the historic shift away from family unification as the backbone=
 of our immigration system,=22 said Kevin Appleby of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bisho=
ps.

Immigrant advocacy and labor groups also oppose the terms of a new guest worker program in w=
hich low-skilled immigrants would be forced to leave the country after temporary stints a=
nd would have limited opportunities to stay and get on a path to permanent legalization.

=22Without a real path to legalization, the program will exclude millions of workers and t=
hus ensure that America will have two classes of workers, only one of which can exercise wor=
kplace rights,=22 said John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO president.

Sen. Byron Dorgan (news, bio, voting record), D-N.D., announced Thursday that he will mov=
e to kill the guest worker program because it would hurt American workers
