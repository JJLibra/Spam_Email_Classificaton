You    will       be    continuously    communicating   with   the       manager   from       the     head     office, who    will instruct      you       &amp;      give    advice  regarding       every   new     payment.<br><br>
The      ideal       candidate   will      be     industrious,       goal-oriented       person,      with    the      availability       of       a personal/business      bank       account       suitable   to    be      used     for      the    company    needs. Knowledge       of     English,       computer  literacy    and    sociability     are appreciated.<br><br>
