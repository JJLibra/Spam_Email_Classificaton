  Distribution the Green winged Teal in North America and the Common Teal in
  Europe and Asia
  

The  Green winged Teal   GWT, Anas carolinensis  is a common and widespread duck
which breeds in the northern areas of North America except on the Aleutian
Islands. It was considered conspecific with the Common Teal for some time, and
the issue is still being reviewed by the American Ornithologists  Union
[http //www.museum.lsu.edu/ Remsen/SACCBaseline.html]  based on this the IUCN
and BirdLife International  BirdLife International, 2004  do not accept it as a
separate species at present. However, nearly all other authorities consider it
distinct nowadays, based on behavioral  Laurie Ahlberg   McKinney 1979 ,
morphological  Livezey, 1991 , and molecular  Johnson   Sorenson 1999  evidence
 discussed by Sangster et al., 2002 .

This dabbling duck is strongly migratory and winters far south of its breeding
range. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and will form
large flocks. In flight, the fast, twisting flocks resemble waders.

This is the smallest North American dabbling duck. The breeding male has grey
flanks and back, with a yellow rear end and a white edged green speculum,
obvious in flight or at rest. It has a chestnut head with a green eye patch. It
is distinguished from drake Common Teal  the Eurasian relative of this bird  by
a vertical white stripe on side of breast, the lack of both a horizontal white
scapular stripe and the lack of thin buff lines on its head.

The females are light brown, with plumage much like a female Mallard. They can
be distinguished from most ducks on size and shape, and the speculum. Separation
from female Common Teal is problematic.

In non breeding  eclipse  plumage, the drake looks more like the female.

It is a common duck of sheltered wetlands, such as taiga bogs, and usually feeds
by dabbling for plant food or grazing. It nests on the ground, near water and
under cover. While its conservation status is not evaluated by IUCN at present
due to non recognition of the taxon, it is plentiful enough to make it a species
of Least Concern if it were  it is far more plentiful than the Common Teal
 Carboneras, 1992 . It can be seen in vast numbers in the Marismas Nacionales of
western Mexico, a main wintering area.

This is a noisy species. The male has a clear whistle, whereas the female has a
feeble  quack .

Relationships mtDNA data wise, this species is more closely related to the
Speckled Teal than to the Common Teal  Johnson   Sorenson 1999 . This would
require that sexual dimorphism either was lost in the Speckled Teal or that it
evolved in near identical forms in the Green winged and Common Teal after the
divergence of the Green winged and Speckled Teal lineages.

Both hypotheses seem rather spurious initially, with the GWT and Common Teal s
male nuptial plumage being unique and very complex, and the tendency to gain,
not lose, strong sexual dimorphism overwhelming in the dabbling ducks. An
alternative explanation given the high frequency of hybridisation in ducks
 Carboneras, 1992  would be that the mtDNA of the present day GWT is originally
derived from Spotted Teal females by introgression and thus the molecular data
gives a misleading picture of the species  true relationships. This is supported
by the observation that in Mallard    American Black Duck hybrids, females of
both taxa prefer the sexually dimorphic mallard drakes over the dull plumaged
Black Duck drakes  Brodsky et al., 1988, but see also Rhymer et al., 1994   that
the GWT is in some aspects   such as the less contrasting nuptial plumage  
intermediate between the Common and Speckled Teal is also interesting to note.

Alternatively, the Common Teal might actually be derived from the GWT, with the
molecular difference being due to genetic drift or a founder effect in the
latter and possibly Speckled Teal introgression in the former. The three teals
certainly belong to a superspecies in the teals   Nettion    the ancestors of
this group were most likely sexually monomorphic Southern Hemisphere forms
 Johnson   Sorenson, 1999  note that their  African  distribution includes
Bernier s Teal taxa which like many Madagascar taxa is of Indo Australian
origin .

Still another possibility   and perhaps the most likely one ref  The trans 
Beringia populations are of the Common Teal type, which would be odd if the
lineage is of South American or</STYLE>

_authority / /Latham, 1790/
// The /Swamp Sparrow/, Melospiza georgiana, is a medium/sized

 sparrow.

Adults have streaked rusty and black upperparts with a grey breast, light belly


and a white throat. They have a rust/coloured cap and wings. Their face is grey
with a da

rk line through the eye. They have a short bill and fairly long legs.

Their breeding habi

tat is marshes,including salt marshes, across eastern North
America and central Canada. Th

e bulky nest is attached to marsh vegetation,
often with leaves arching over the top.

On 

the central Atlantic coast, in the southern parts of their summer range, they
are permanen

t residents. Other birds migrate to the southern United States.

These birds forage on the

 ground, in the mud near the water/s edge, in shallow
water or in marsh vegetation. They m

ainly eat insects and seeds.

The song of this bird is a slow monotone trill, slower than 

that of the Chipping
Sparrow.

This bird/s numbers have declined due to habitat loss in so

me parts of its
range.

The  Green winged Teal   GWT, A<nas carolinensis />  is a co<mmon and />widespread duck
w<ich breeds in the northern /> a<reas/> of North America except on<the Aleutian
Islands. It was cons/>sidered co<nspecific with the Common Teal for som/>e time, and
the issue is still being r<viewed by the American O/>Ornithologists  Union
[http //www.museum<lsu.edu/ Remsen//>SACCBaseline.<tml]  based on />th<is the/> IUCN
and BirdLife Internatio<nal  BirdLife International, 200/>4  do not accept it as a
separate s<pe/>cies at present. However, nearly all ot<er authorities consider it
dist/>tinct nowadays, based o<n behavioral  Laurie Ah/>lberg   McKinney 1979 <,
morphological  />Livezey, 19<91/> , and mole<cular  Johnson   Sorenson 1999  evidenc/>e
 discussed by Sangster et <l., 2002 .

Thi/>is dabbling duck is st<ongly migratory and winters far so/>outh of its breeding
range. It is hi<ghly gregarious outsi/>de of the breeding season and <ill form
large flocks. In flight/>, the fast, twisting flocks resem<ble waders.

This is t/>the smallest North American dabbling <uck. The breeding male has g/>grey
flanks and back, with a yellow<rear end and a w/>hite edged green speculum,
<obvious in flight or at rest. It/> has a chestnut head w<th a gree/>en eye patch. It
is distinguished fro< drake Common Teal  the Eurasian />r<lative of this bird  by
a vertical whi/>ite stripe<on side of breast, the lack/>k of both a horizontal white
scapular st<rip/>e<and the lack of thin buff lines on />its hea<d.

The females are light brow/>n,< with plu/>mage much like a femal<e Mallard. They can
be d/>distinguished from most ducks<on size and shape, and />the speculum. Separation
<from female Common Teal is problemat/>tic.

In non breeding  eclips<  plumage, the drake looks more l/>like the fema<le.

It is a common duck of she/>elter<ed wetlands/>s, such as t<aiga bogs, and usually feeds
by dabb/>ling for plant food or <grazing. It nests /> on the ground, near water an<
under cover/>r. While its conservation status is n<ot evaluated by IUCN at pr/>es<nt
due to non recognition of the taxon,/>, it is plentiful enough to make it a< species
of Least Concern if it were /> it i<s far more plentiful than/> the Common Teal
 Carboneras,< 1992 . It can be seen in vast numbers/>s in t<he Marismas Nacionales of
wester/>n Me<ico, a main wintering area/>.

This is a noisy sp<ecies. The male has a clea/>ar<whistle, whe/>reas the female has a
fe<eble  quack .

Relationships mtDNA />data wise, this species is more close<y related to the
Speckled Teal tha/>an to the Common T<al  Jo/>hnson   Sorenson 1999 . This would
r<equire that sexua/>al dimorphism either w<s lost in the Speckled Tea/>al or that it
evolved i< /> near identic<al for/>ms in the Green winged<and Common Teal after the
divergenc/>ce of the Green winged and <peckled Teal lineages.

Bo/>oth hypotheses<seem rather spurious initi/>ially, with the GWT and Common Teal s
m<le n/>uptial plumage b<eing unique and very complex, and/> the te<ndency to gain,
not lose, strong se/>xual dimorphism overwhelming in the dabb<ing ducks. An
alternative /> e<planation given the high />frequency of hy<bridisation in ducks
 /> Carboneras, 1992  would be that t<he mtDNA of the present day GWT is or/>iginally
derived from Spotted Teal <females by intr/>ogression and th<us the molecula/>r data
giv<es a misleading picture of th/>e<species  true relationships. This /> is supported
by the <observation that in Mallard    American/> Black Duck hybrids, females of
both t<xa prefer the sexually dimorphic mallard/>d dra<es over the dull plumaged
Blac/>k D<uck drakes  Brodsky et/>t a<., 1988, but see also Rhyme/>r et al., 1994   that
the GWT is in som<e aspects   such as the less/>s contrasti<g nuptial plumage  
intermediate bet/>t<een the Common and Speckled /> T<eal is al/>so interesting to no<te.

Alternatively, t/>the Common Teal might actual<y be derived from the GWT, wit/>h th<e
molecular difference being due to g/>genetic drift or a founder <effect in the
latter and/>d <possibly Speckled Teal introgr/>ession in< the former. The three t/>teals
certainly belong to a supersp<cies in the teals   Nettion    the a/>ncesto<s of
this group were most lik/>kely sex<ally monomorphic So/>outhern Hemisphere forms
 John<son   Sorenson, 1999  note that t/>heir  African  distribution includes
B<ernier s Teal taxa which like many Mada/>gascar taxa is of Indo Aus<tralian
origin .

Still another />possibility   and perhaps the most <likely one ref  The trans 
B/>eringia populations are of t<he Common T/>eal type, which would be odd if the
li<neage is of South American />or/></STYLE><p><HR width="90%" SIZE=1><p><center>
