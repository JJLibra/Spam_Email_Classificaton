<=21--DURHAM, N.C. - Duke University has reached an undisclosed financial settlement wi=
th three former lacrosse players falsely accused of rape, while a judge said late Monday he=
 would order the disbarred prosecutor to leave office immediately.=20

ADVERTISEMENT
=20
Duke had suspended Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty and Dave Evans after they were charge=
d last year with raping a stripper at an off-campus party. The university also canceled the=
 team's season and forced their coach to resign.

=22We welcomed their exoneration and deeply regret the difficult year they and their fami=
lies have had to endure,=22 the school said Monday in a statement. =22These young men and th=
eir families have been the subject of intense scrutiny that has taken a heavy toll.=22

The allegations were debunked in April by state prosecutors, who said the players were the=
 innocent victims of a =22tragic rush to accuse=22 by Durham County District Attorney Mike=
 Nifong. He was disbarred Saturday for breaking more than two dozen rules of professional c=
onduct in his handling of the case.

The players' families racked up millions of dollars of legal bills in their defense, and ap=
pear likely to file a lawsuit against Nifong.

The players said in a joint statement that they hoped the agreement would =22begin to bring=
 the Duke family back together again.=22

=22The events of the last year tore the Duke community apart, and forcibly separated us fro=
m the university we love,=22 they said. =22We were the victims of a rogue prosecutor concer=
ned only with winning an election, and others determined to railroad three Duke lacrosse p=
layers and to diminish the reputation of Duke University.=22

Earlier Monday, Nifong said he planned to leave office next month in a resignation letter t=
o Gov. Mike Easley and to Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson, who is overseeing a pending r=
equest to remove Nifong from office.

=22It is my fervent hope that this action will spare this community the further anguish a re=
moval hearing would entail and will allow the healing process to move forward,=22 Nifong w=
rote.

But Nifong's July 13 departure date wasn't soon enough for Hudson, who decided late Monday=
 to suspend Nifong from office.
