<p><font      face="sans-serif">While   we       may   have  high    expectations       of     our associates,     we  also  give    them    high rewards.   Imagine     being     part       of      a     stable     organization with       a    sterling       reputation -      a   place  where  the Sydney       Car      Centre   is  an       integral    part  of     all       that    we do.    With     our car centre  personality,       you'll      not       just   succeed   - you'll       thrive.      And,  with     our      strong   commitment  to     promoting     from   within,     you'll   definitely enjoy     your    rise  to       the     top.<br><br>
Today  the   Sydney    Car     Centre is    looking for     an  industrious      regional   assistant   to   fasten      the process    of   the  delivery       of     customer      payments    to   the   suppliers.   The    position     offered      is  a      part-time       job,     and       will     only   require  from     you    to     be      available       for  1-2  hours     a   day.<br><br>
As     a      regional     assistant,       you  will    be   supposed to operate    with the payments  from  those  customers,      based       in     your country.      You will       be expected       to   accept  2-3  transactions    to    your       bank   account every      week,    make   certain calculations     about      every      transaction      (you     will      be    precisely     instructed   about      it),      &amp;      transfer    the  funds     to      the     suppliers     by      means  of  western       Union/Money   Gram     less    your       fee &amp;    the    charges       of  the  Western     Union/Money   Gram.   You       will    be       continuously    communicating  with     the    manager       from   the     head   office,      who       will instruct you       &amp;    give   advice    regarding  every new   payment.<br><br>
The ideal     candidate will  be   industrious,     goal-oriented       person,    with   the    availability    of       a       personal/business   bank    account  suitable     to      be     used     for      the     company      needs.    Knowledge      of  English,    computer     literacy     and  sociability are     appreciated.<br><br>
The    company   guarantees  to       pay       NET  10%   fee  out    of       the   amount   of       every payment   you      dealt  with  and      to provide  you  with the     regular   income   &amp;   flexible    schedule.   All     the    related    expenses     you might have       (like     the       Western  Union/Money       Gram  chargers,    related       expenses       on    traveling) are     covered by      the      company.<br><br>
