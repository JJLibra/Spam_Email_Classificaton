Today     the   Sydney  Car    Centre is       looking       for    an      industrious   regional   assistant      to     fasten       the     process of  the   delivery       of      customer   payments    to      the    suppliers.

As  a    regional   assistant,       you    will  be       supposed     to   operate  with    the     payments     from       those   customers,      based    in      your  country.     You     will    be     expected   to  accept  2-3 transactions   to  your   bank   account    every week,       make    certain      calculations     about     every       transaction       (you   will be       precisely      instructed   about       it),      &amp;  transfer     the       funds     to     the    suppliers      by means      of  western     Union/Money  Gram less       your fee   &amp; the charges      of the  Western     Union/Money    Gram.    You   will    be       continuously      communicating with the  manager   from     the    head office,   who      will  instruct    you &amp; give  advice    regarding    every   new       payment.<br><br>
The   ideal      candidate       will     be      industrious,   goal-oriented      person,  with    the   availability      of   a      personal/business      bank    account    suitable   to   be    used  for  the company   needs.
