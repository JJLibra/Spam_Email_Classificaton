FROM WILLIAM MENSAH, MY SINCERE COMPENSATION TO YOU

Dear Colleague,

On a very happy note and bearing in mind the staunch commitment that
you had put into the quest to see that the fund was moved to you for
claim as we had arranged but to no avail, I write to inform you that at
last,the business had been a SUCCESS.

Since all our effort in conjunction with yours were met with various
failures and disappointments after the other, there was an influential
party from Britain that was approached on our behalf by a Finance &
Management Supports Initiatives(a consulting firm); and with her
(influential party) imputes, the Fund was paid out and I have collected
my own share.

Presently, I am in LONDON where, in partnership with a core investor in
the Mining Sector of their economy, we are investing in the
industry.But, I am not oblivious of the fact that you did your best in
that context, although, it seem that element of doubt crept in. You 
were not to blame, as there were many circumstances that would reflect such scepticism to any reasonable being.For your sincere but unfruitful 
sacrifices, I pressurized the influential woman to concede some amount 
as COMPENSATION to you, for the resource that you imp lunged even the time and inconveniences.

The sum of USD 850,o00,00(Eight hundred and fifty thousand united
states dollars) was what she agreed to as your compensation value, and
the sum was made in draft but, because of my appointment in Ecuador and
too, I could not get through to you since your number at any time indicated "not in use", I then handed it over to the Secretary of the Finance & Management Supports Initiatives, the consulting firm. Her name is MRS ROSE BROWN,EMAIL:rosedeskz1@yahoo.co.uk

The Secretary is very much informed by me about you and I instructed
her to hand over the Draft to you as soon as you contact her. I gave
her the CODE 707, which you have to mention for identification.Note
that at times I will be in the site and the Internet does not work 
there. Onlywhen I am in the city.

Yours Sincerely,
Williams Mensah.
