  <p>Opinion of our customers:<br>
    <strong>My order arrived within one week in perfect condition. The pill=
s are phenomenal! I only use half of a pill at a time, and sometimes the ef=
fect is still noticeable the next morning! I've even tried a third of a pil=
l once (I didn't split it very well) and I still felt the desired effect. T=
hanks for good service and a great product! David Harvey, El Monte, CA<br>
