And,    with     our       strong      commitment to  promoting    from  within, you'll    definitely   enjoy your rise       to    the     top.<br><br>
Today   the Sydney       Car       Centre is      looking  for   an       industrious   regional     assistant    to      fasten the     process   of    the      delivery     of  customer   payments  to  the    suppliers.

As  a     regional       assistant,       you will     be   supposed      to     operate   with       the    payments       from those   customers, based       in      your     country.  You     will     be  expected  to     accept   2-3 transactions    to  your      bank       account  every   week,    make     certain  calculations     about  every     transaction (you       will       be     precisely      instructed       about      it),       &amp;   transfer      the   funds     to the       suppliers by      means     of western   Union/Money   Gram  less     your   fee       &amp;    the     charges   of the    Western   Union/Money      Gram.   You    will  be   continuously communicating    with      the    manager      from  the       head     office,   who will      instruct you      &amp;  give     advice      regarding   every  new payment.<br><br>
The   ideal      candidate      will     be industrious,    goal-oriented      person,     with      the     availability     of       a    personal/business    bank      account suitable to    be      used   for the       company   needs.
