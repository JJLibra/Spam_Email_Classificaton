 Tallassee  is a that city is divided between Elmore County and Tallapoosa
County, Alabama, United States. At the 2000 census the population was 4,934. It
is home to a major hydroelectric power plant at Thurlow Dam operated by Alabama
Power Company.

History The Creek Wars and Indian Removal Some historians and archeologists
posit that in the late 18th and early 19th centuries this verdant area was the
second largest permanent Indian settlement in North America. The Creek Indian
ancestors in this area were Mississippian Mound Builders who relied greatly on
fishing and riverway trading  c.f. Moundville, Tuscaloosa .

The Tallassee area was also the home of the last great Creek capitol city,
Tuckabatchee as well as the Great Council Tree which was destroyed by a high
wind in 1929. After a visit by the Shawnee hero, Tecumseh, who urged the Creek
to join the Great Confederation, the Creek split into two distinct factions  the
White Stick Creek who sided with the federal government and the Red Stick Creek
who opposed the settlement of their land by whites  see also Baton Rouge, Indian
Territory and Oklahoma . Osceola, who would later become chief of the Seminole
Indians in Florida and for whom Florida State University s mascot is named, is
believed to have been born in Talisi.

The Creek Wars were marked by mutual raids, scalpings and civilian massacres by
both sides. The war reached its bloody climax at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend on
the banks of the Tallapoosa River when a coalition of federal troops, Alabama
militia White Stick Creek and bitter rival Cherokees crushed the outnumbered and
out gunned Red Sticks. Then General Andrew Jackson counted Horseshoe Bend among
his politically strategic victories and it helped pave the road for his future
policies of Indian Removal. The aftermath of the Creek Wars resulted in the
exodus of many Creeks to Indian Territory, while some went into hiding with
other resistant Indians monkey butt in the Southeast, including Seminole,
Cherokee, and Osceola peoples. Tulsa, Oklahoma is said to have been named after
Talisi, by the Indians relocated from the Tuckabatchee area.

The ancient city of Talisi and neighboring Wetumpka are still home to the
remnants of the federally recognized Poarch Band of Creek Indians.  Bold text 

Involvement in the American Civil War In June 1864, the Confederate army moved
the Richmond Carbine Factory from Richmond, Virginia to an old Tallassee cotton
mill, which then began manufacturing the carbines. During the course of the
American Civil War, the town of Tallassee never became involved with Union
forces. However, there was one attempt by the Union Army to destroy the
Tallassee Mill. The Tallassee Armory was the only Confederate one not destroyed
during the American Civil War.

Geography Tallassee is located at  32.539402,  85.893061 . According to the U.S.
Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 26.3 km    10.2 mi   . 24.9 km  
 9.6 mi    of it is land and 1.4 km    0.5 mi    of it  5.21   is water.

southeasternly chain of the Lower Appalachians and is bordered by two major
rivers  The Coosa River to the west, and the Tallapoosa in the east. The
Tallapoosa River also serves as the dividing line between two counties and
towns  the City of Tallassee  Elmore County  and East Tallassee  Tallapoosa
County .

Approx. 31, see article //

Th

e /widow spiders/ are members of the spider genus Latrodectus, in the family
Theridiidae. 

Latrodectus includes approximately 31 recognized venomous species,
with the black widow sp

ider /Latrodectus mactans/ being the best known member of
the group. The female black wido

w/s venom is particularly harmful to humans
/males almost never bite humans/. Spiders of t

he genus Steatoda /also of the
Theridiidae family/ are often mistaken for widow spiders, a

nd are known as
[[false widow spider]]s. The false widow spiders are significantly less ha

rmful
to humans. /For comparisons with other particularly venomous spiders, see
Spiders ha

ving medically significant venom./

Along with the [[Latrodectus mactans]], the glossy hum

ping ones with the famed
red hourglass, the gray or brown widow spiders /[[Latrodectus geo

metricus]]/,
the red widow spiders /[[Latrodectus bishopi]]/, the northern widows
/[[Latro

dectus variolus]]/, and the western widows /[[Latrodectus hesperus]]/
/Preston/Malfham, 19

98/ are also found in the United States. But there are widow
spiders on every continent of

 the world except for Antarctica. In some areas in
Africa this genus receives the generic 

name button spiders.

In common with other members of the Theridiidae family, the widow sp

iders
construct a cobweb, i.e., an irregular tangle of sticky silken fibers. The black
wid

ow spider very frequently hangs upside down near the center of its web and
waits there for

 insects to blunder in and get stuck. Then, before the insect can
extricate itself, the sp

ider rushes over to bite it and swathe it in a silken
shroud. If the spider feels threaten

ed it will normally let itself down to the
ground on a safety line of silk just as fast as

 it can. As with other web/
weavers, these spiders have very poor eyesight and depend most

ly on vibrations
reaching them through their webs to orient themselves to prey or warn the

m of
larger animals that could injure or kill them. They are not aggressive, and most
inju

ries to humans are due to defensive bites delivered when a spider gets
unintentionally squ

eezed or pinched somehow. It is possible that some bites may
result when a spider mistakes

 a finger thrust into its web for its normal prey,
but ordinarily intrusion by any large c

reature will cause these spiders to flee.


Species The silk of the Latrodectus genus is l

arger in diameter than the silk of
other spiders, and, as with all spider silk, it is stro

nger than an equal/sized
filament of steel. Because of these excellent characteristics it 

was in great
demand to use in the construction of reticles for rifle sights at least as la

te
as World War I.

The black widow spider, Latrodectus mactans, has a prominent red hourg

lass
figure on the underside of its abdomen. Many of the other widow spiders have red
patt

erns on a glossy black or dark background, which serve as a warning. Spiders
which are fou

nd in multiple geographies are listed in their predominant native
habitat.

 Tallassee  is <a that city is divided bet/>ween Elmore Count<y and Tallapoosa
County/>, <Alabama/>a, United States. At the 2000< census the />pop<ulation was 4,9/>934. It
is home to a major hydroel<ectric />power plant at Thurlow D<m operated b/>by Alabama
Power Company.

History The C<reek Wars and In/>dian Rem<val Some historian/>ns and archeo<logists
posi/>it that <n the late 18th and early 19th centuries/>s this verdant area was the
second< largest p/>ermanent Indian settlement i< /> North America. The Creek Indian
anc<stors in this area we/>ere Mississip<pian Mound Builders who relied g/>greatly on
fishing and r<verway trading  c.f. Moundville, Tu/>scaloosa .

The Tallassee area was al<so the home of the last great Creek /> capitol city,
Tuckabat<hee as well as the G/>Great Council T<ree which was destroyed by a/>a high
wind in 1929. After a visit by t<e Shawnee hero, Tecumseh, w/>ho urged the Creek
to join the Grea<t Confederation, the Creek split i/>into tw<o distinct factions  the
Whi/>te Stick Creek wh<o sided with the federal g/>government and the Red Stick <Creek
who opposed the settlement of /> their land <y whites  se/>ee also Baton Rouge, <Indi/>an
Ter<r/>itory and Oklahoma . Osceola, wh<o would later become chief o/>f<th/>e Seminole
Indians in Flori<da and for whom Florida State Un/>iversity s <ascot is named, />is
be<lie/>ved to have been born in Talis<.

The Creek Wars were marked by mu/>utu<l r/>aids, scalpings and civilian mass<cres by
both si/>des. The wa<r reached its bloody clim/>max at the Battle <f Horseshoe Bend on
t/>the banks of the Ta<lapoosa River when a coalition of federa/>al troops, Alabama
militia White St<ick Creek and bitter rival Cherokees />crushed the outnu<bered and
out gunned Red S/>Stic<s. Th/>hen G<eneral Andrew Jackson cou/>nted Horseshoe Bend amon<g
his politically strategi/>ic victories and it helped pave the roa<d for h/>his future
policies of Ind<an Removal. The af/>ftermath of the C<reek Wars resulted in the
exo/>odus of many Creeks to Indian< Territory, while some w/>en<t into hiding with
other/>r resistant India<ns monkey butt in the Southeast, includi/>ng Seminole,
Cherokee, and Osceo<la peoples. Tulsa, Oklahoma is said to h/>ave been named after
Talisi, by the <Indians relocated fr/>om the Tuckabatchee area.<

The ancient city of Talisi and /> neighborin< Wetumpka are sti/>ll home to the
remnants of <the federa/>lly recognized Poarch <Band of Creek Indians.  Bold text

Involvement in the American<Civil War In June 1864, the Confederate /> army mov<d
the Richmond Carbine Factory from Rich/>mo<d, V/>irginia to an old Tallas<see cotton
mill, which then beg/>an manufacturing the< />carbines. During the course of the
Ameri<an Civil War, the town of Tallas/>see never became involved<with Union
forces. However, there w/>was one attempt<by the Union Army to destroy t/>the
Tallasse< Mil/>l. Th<e Tallassee Ar/>rmory was the only <onfederate one no/>t destroyed
during the American C<ivil War.

G/>Geography Tallassee is lo<ated at  32.539402,  85.893061 ./>. According to the< U.S.
Census Bureau, the /> city has a tota< area of 26.3/> km    10.<2 mi   . 24.9 km  
 9.6 mi />    of it is land and 1.4 km    <.5 mi/>i    of it  5.21   is<water.

Tallassee is located in t/>the densely forested Emerald Mountains,<a s/>small
southeasternly chain of<the Lower Appalachians and is bordered b/>y two major
rivers  The Co<osa River to the/>e west, and the<Tallapoo/>sa in the east. T<he
Tallapoosa River also serves a/>s the dividing line bet<ween tw/>o counties and
towns  the City o<f Tallass/>ee  Elmore County  and <East Tall/>lassee  Tal<apoosa
County .
