Dear theorize@plg.uwaterloo.ca

In this issue:

Imagine a sweater you can wear in July! This week we have three light-as-lace sweater kits that are as beautiful and decorative as jewelry -- and they're on sale. Thanks to Jazz and Muse, our linen and fine cotton yarns, you can enjoy the relaxation of knitting, even for summer fashions.

If you are looking for something unique to make for graduation, our Ruffles ascots fit the bill. Ruffles is a tape yarn that magically knits up into a romantic ruffle. Knitting with Ruffles requires a slightly different, but simple technique that you can see in video by clicking here.
The new knit.1 magazine is now on the newsstands and you can order directly from us as well.

This issue, the "Green Issue" offers great patterns and ideas for working with Lion Organic Cotton.	

Eco-Friendly Shopping Bag

For crocheters, we have a special 50% off sale on one of our most popular items: a shawl that you can make as a prayer shawl or gift for anyone who wants to add a touch of warmth in a chilly home. Best of all, this works up quickly with a size N-13 hook so you can make it in a few hours. If you'd like to read more about prayer shawls, you'll enjoy the book The Prayer Shawl Ministry:  Reaching Those in Need

With Warmest Regards
Lion Brand Yarn
