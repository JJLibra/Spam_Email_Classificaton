Hi, Ralph

I ask you to save this first letter from me; It doesn't matter that we 
don’t know each other. Maybe one day we'll read our letters to our children 
an we will show them this the first letter which was the key into our happy 
life. Just imagine, Dear Stranger, that you get married me, and every day 
you are happy, because you are beloved, you love. I found you here and 
something gave me a hint that you're as lonely as I am. and It doesn't 
matter who made the fist step, do you agree with me?
It's very important that we found each other. Don't lose a chance to write 
me http://allwaylove.com/tearslove
Maybe we'll sit together and tell our children a wonderful story about our 
acquaintance in close future.

Hugs
J. D.
