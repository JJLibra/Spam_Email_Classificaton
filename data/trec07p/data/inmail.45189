Discern of the coming on of years, and think not to do the same things
still for age will not be defied.
Dogs come when they are called cats take a message and get back to you.
In advertising, not to be different is virtual suicide.
You never know what's hit you. A gunshot is the perfect way.
We do not look in our great cities for our best morality.
The only legitimate artists in England are the architects.
A book worth reading is worth buying.
Action is the last resource of those who know not how to dream.
Never find fault with the absent.
We all know that sponges grow in the ocean but I wander how much deeper
the ocean would be if that wasn't the case.
The old believe everything the middle aged suspect everything, and the
young know everything.
A lot of what acting is paying attention.
Danger past, God forgotten.
Diaper backward spells repaid. Think about it.
Youth is a blunder, manhood is a struggle and old age a regret.
Every man is a volume if you know how to read him.
Every man is a volume if you know how to read him.
People want riches they need fulfillment.
The physician can bury his mistakes, but the architect can only advise
his clients to plant vines.
