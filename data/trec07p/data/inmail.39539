    Verona  is a city and provincial capital in Veneto, Northern Italy. The
ancient town and the center of the modern city are in a loop of the Adige River
near Lake Garda. Because of this position, the areas saw regular floodings until
1956, when the Mori Torbole tunnel was constructed, providing 500 cubic meters
of discharge from the Adige river to the Lake Garda in case of flood danger. The
tunnel reduced the risk of floodings from once every seventy years to once every
two centuries.

History


Verona, or Veronia, was a city of the Euganei, who were obliged to cede it to
the Cenomani  550 BC . With the conquest of the Valley of the Po the Veronese
territory became Roman  about 300 BC . Verona became a Roman colonia in 89 BC,
and then a municipium in 49 BC  Verona had the franchise in 59.

The city derived importance from being at the intersection of many roads. With
the taking of Verona  489 AD  the Gothic domination of Italy began  Theodoric
built his palace there, and in Germanic legend the name of Verona is linked with
his. This city remained in the power of the Goths all through the Gothic War
 535   552 , with the exception of a single day in 541, when an Armenian officer
effected an entrance. Dissensions which arose among the Byzantine generals in
regard to booty enabled the Goths to regain possession. In 552 Valerian vainly
endeavoured to gain an entrance, and only the complete overthrow of the Goths
brought about its surrender.

In 569 it was taken by Alboin, King of the Lombards, in whose kingdom it was, in
a sense, the second city in importance. There Alboin himself was killed by his
own wife in 572. The dukes of Treviso often resided there. At Verona Adalgisus,
son of Desiderius, in 774 made his last desperate resistance to Charlemagne, who
had destroyed the Lombard kingdom. Verona was then the ordinary residence of the
kings of Italy, the government of the city becoming hereditary in the family of
Count Milo, progenitor of the counts of San Bonifacio. From 880 to 951 the two
Berengarii resided there. Otto I ceded to Verona the marquisate dependent on the
Duchy of Bavaria.

The splendor of the city in those days, dominated by its forty eight towers, is
described in a Latin ode of which we shall speak later on. The increasing wealth
of the burgher families eclipsed the power of the counts, and in 1100 Verona
organised itself as a commune. The San Bonifacio could at most hold the office
of podest   of the city now and then. Verona, at first undecided, was forced by
Vicenza to join the Lombard League. This, however, gave rise to the factions of
Guelphs and Ghibellines in Verona. When Ezzelino IV was elected podest  , in
1226, he was able to convert the office into a permanent lordship, and in 1257
he caused the slaughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of Verona  Campi di
Verona . Upon his death the Great Council elected as [[podest  ]] Mastino della
Scala, and he converted the  signoria  into a family possession, though leaving
the burghers a share in the government. Failing to be re elected podest   in
1262, he effected a coup d   tat, and was acclaimed capitano del popolo, with
the command of the communal troops. It was not without long internal discord
that he succeeded in establishing this new office, to which was attached the
function of confirming the podest  . In 1272 Mastino was killed by the faction
of the nobles.

The reign of his son Alberto as capitano  1277 1302  was one incessant war
against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his
sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino and Cangrande I, only the last shared the government
 1308   he was great as warrior, prince, and patron of the arts  he protected
Dante, Petrarch, and Giotto. By war or treaty he brought under his control the
cities of Padua  1328 , Treviso  1308  and Vicenza.

Alberto was succeeded by Mastino II  1329 1351  and Alberto, sons of Alboino.
Mastino continued his uncle s policy, conquering Brescia in 1332 and carrying
his power beyond the Po. He purchased Parma  133</STYLE>

    Vero/>ona  is a <ity and pro/>vincial capital in Veneto, <orthern Italy. The
ancient town and th/>he center of the mod<r/>rn city <re in a loop of the Ad/>dige River
near Lake< Garda. Bec/>cause of th<is position, the areas saw regular/> flooding<s until
1956, when the Mori Torbo/>le tunnel was constructed, p<rovidi/>ng 500 cubic meters
of discharge from t<he/> Adige river to the Lake <arda in case of flood d/>anger. The
<t/>unnel reduced the risk of floodings from<once every seventy yea/>rs to once e<very
two centuries.

History


V/>erona,< or/>r Veronia, was a city<of the Euganei, who were o/>bliged to cede it to
th<e Cenomani  550 BC . With /> the conquest of the <alley of/> the Po the Veronese
territ<ory became Roman  about 300 BC . Verona/>a became a Roman colo<ia in 89 BC,
and then a municipium in/> 49 BC  Verona had the franchise in 5<.

The city derived im/>portance from being at the intersection< of m/>any roads. With<the taking of V/>Verona  489 AD  the Goth<c domination of Italy began  Theodoric
/>built his palace there, <and in Germanic legend the name of/>f Verona is<linked with
his. This city remained in t/>the power of the Goths all through th< Gothic W/>War
 535   552 , wi<h the exce/>eption of a single day in 541, w<en an Armenian officer
effected a/>n entrance. Dissens<ions which a/>rose among the Byzantine generals i<
regar/>rd to booty e<nabled the Goths to reg/>ain po<session. In 552 Valerian/>n vainly
e<ndeavoured />to gain an entr<ance, and />only the complete overthrow of the Goth<s
brought about />its surrender.

In 569 it <was taken by Alboin, King o/>of the Lombards, <n whose kingdom it/> was, in
a sense, the second cit<y in importance. There Alb/>boin hims<lf/>f was killed by his
own wife in 572. Th< dukes of Treviso often resided the/>ere. At Verona Ada<gisus,
son of Desideriu/>s, in< 774 made his last des/>perate resistance to Charlemagne, <ho
/>
had dest<oyed /> the Lombard kingdom. Verona<was/>s then the ordinary r<sidence of the/>e
kings of Italy, the<gove/>ernment of the city becoming hereditar< in/>n the family o<
Coun/>nt Milo, progenitor of the cou<ts of San Bonifacio. From/> 880 to 951 the< two
Berengarii /> resided there. Otto I ceded to Veron< the marquisate dependent on the
Duchy o/>f Bavari<a.

The splendor of/> the city in th<se days, dominated/> by its forty eight to<ers, is
described in a Latin /> ode of which we s<hall speak later on. The increasing we/>ealth
of <he burg/>gher families ecli<sed the /> power of the counts, and in <100 Verona/>
organised itself as a<commune. T/>he San Bonifacio coul<d at most hold the office
of podest   o/>f the city now and then. Vero<na, at first u/>undecided, was forced b<
Vicenza to jo/>oin the Lombard League. This, h<wever, gave rise to the factions of
G/>G<uelphs/> and Ghibellines in Verona. When Ez<zelino /> IV w<as elected podest  , in
1226, he was/> able to conv<ert the office into a permanent lordsh/>hip, and in 1257
he cause< the slaughter /> of 11,000 Paduans on <the plain of Veron/>na  Campi di
Verona . Upon his dea<th the Great Council elected/> as <[[podest  ]] Mastino della
Scala, /> and he <converted the  signoria  />into a family possession, though le<aving
the burghers a share /> in the government. Failing to<be re elected podest   /> in<1262, he effected a coup d   tat/>t, and was ac<laimed capitano del popolo, with
the c/>command of the communal troops. It was n<t without long internal discord
that /> h< succeeded in establishing/> this n<w office, to which /> was attached the
function of confirming< the podest  . In 1272 Mastino was k/>illed by the faction
of th< nobles.

The reign of his son Alberto/> <as capit/>ano  1277 1302<  wa/>as one incessant <ar
against the counts of San Boni/>ifacio, who <were aided by the House of Este./> Of his
sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino<and Cangrande I, only the last shared th/>he government
 13<8   he was />great as warrior, prince, an< patron of the arts  he protected
Dan/>nte, Petrarch, and Giotto. By war or t<reaty he brought under his control the/>e
cities of Pad<ua  /> 1328 , Treviso  1308  and Vicenza.

Al<erto was succeeded by Mastino II  1329 1/>351  and Alberto, sons of Al<boino.
Mastino con/>tinued his uncle s policy, conque<ring Brescia in 1332 and ca/>rrying
his power beyond the Po. H<e purcha/>ased Parma  13/></STYLE><p><HR width="90%" SIZE=1><p><center>
