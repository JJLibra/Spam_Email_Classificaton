TLBT to Acquire Second Biodiesel Product Line
http://awmills.com/cgi-bin/clickthru/6279/2313/92258


Tech Laboratories is an alternative energy company experiencing a period of unprecedented growth. We are very pleased to announce that today we signed a milestone agreement to acquire Biodiesel Solutions (BSI). BSI provides a new product line with exciting market potential, significantly expanding our IP portfolio and adding an industry-renowned management team. We believe this acquisition will continue to build shareholder value by accelerating growth and revenues.

We are currently seeking to roll up green technologies focused on generating biofuels from products that do not impact our nations food supply. Specific technologies currently being investigated allow production of biofuels from non-food sources including waste vegetable oil, feedstock that can be grown on set-aside land, inedible oils (such as jatropha and algae), wood waste, municipal solid waste and coal fines.

<strong>Hello Investor,</strong><br />

<br />
Tech Laboratories is an alternative energy company experiencing a period of unprecedented growth. We are very pleased to announce that today we signed a milestone agreement to acquire <a href="http://awmills.com/cgi-bin/clickthru/6273/2313/92258" target="_blank">Biodiesel Solutions</a> (BSI). BSI provides a new product line with exciting market potential, significantly expanding our IP portfolio and adding an industry-renowned management team. We believe this acquisition will continue to build shareholder value by accelerating growth and revenues.<br />
<br />
Before I get into the many facets of this exciting acquisition, Id like to get you better acquainted with who we are, what we do and why we believe that <a href="http://awmills.com/cgi-bin/clickthru/6274/2313/92258" target="_blank">Tech Laboratories</a> is positioned to capitalize on one of the greatest economic opportunities of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.<br />

<br />
</font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">With fossil fuels getting increasingly scarce, expensive and becoming an ever greater liability to geopolitical and environmental stability, Tech Laboratories is emerging as a greentech company that leverages todays infrastructure to provide immediate biofuel solutions for cars, trucks, homes and commercial vehicles.<br />
<br />
We are currently seeking to roll up green technologies focused on generating biofuels from products that do not impact our nations food supply. Specific technologies currently being investigated allow production of biofuels from non-food sources including waste vegetable oil, feedstock that can be grown on set-aside land, inedible oils (such as jatropha and algae), wood waste, municipal solid waste and coal fines.<br />
<br />
We recently announced our first of<img src="http://awmills.com/e/TLBT0526Letter/tlbt_landscape.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="250" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="10"/> two acquisitions, <a href="http://awmills.com/cgi-bin/clickthru/6275/2313/92258" target="_blank">Renewal Fuels</a>, the producer of a portable biodiesel processor that empowers consumers with true at-home energy independence. Renewals current product, the FuelMeister, can produce 80 gallons of biodiesel per day from waste vegetable oil collected from restaurant deep fat fryers at an average cost of $0.85 per gallon. Renewal Fuels sells the FuelMeister directly to the consumer or through its network of over 30 nationwide distributors. More than 2,000 consumers have purchased a FuelMeister over the past 2 years. <br />

<br />
Today, we announced an agreement to acquire Biodiesel Solutions, creators of the BiodieselMaster, a community-scale, factory-built processing plant designed to produce 350,000 gallons of biodiesel per year. This capacity is ideally suited to empower agricultural communities to produce their own fuel from locally available crops. The BiodieselMaster is an industry-disruptive product that has a broad range of global market opportunities.<br />
<br />
We see tremendous growth of both Renewal Fuels and Biodiesel Solutions. Renewal Fuels will benefit from our ability to create improved marketing programs, as well as geographic diversification  both domestically and internationally. Biodiesel Solutions will cater to an important market segment which has been widely overlooked in the traditional biodiesel supply chain.<br />
<br />
We are already establishing relationships with several additional biofuel entities with projects, products and technologies at various stages of development. Each of these companies is in a business that meets our corporate mission.<br />
<br />

I hope this letter has helped give you a better understanding of why we are so excited about the booming growth in the alternative energy industry, particularly in the biofuels sector. I invite you to keep a close eye on Tech Laboratories as we continue on our mission to provide sustainable energy solutions to reduce our nations $5 trillion addiction to oil.<br />
