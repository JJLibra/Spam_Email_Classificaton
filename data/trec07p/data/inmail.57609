        Dear StockUpTicks Reader:

        After a significant quiet period and retreat in the
        company's stock price, we're pleased to be able to
        reintroduce one of our top performing equities in
        StockUpTicks.com’s seven year history.

        With the uranium spot price ($135+) in the stratosphere
        and the company's shares drastically reduced during the
        quiet period in which they published little-to-no news,
        Uranium Energy Corp (OCTBB:URME) again proves to be an
        intriguing study in one of the hottest, if not the
        hottest, sectors of the market.

        And if you're wondering why URME retreated in price
        during the quiet period, two analysts have offered
        their measured thoughts on this subject, indicating an
        opportunity may be afoot. With URME having reached
        $7.39 not so long ago and hovering near $4.00 now,
        these two articles may well be worth reading.

          Here’s a link to each article.  Be sure to check out
                   the news on URME excerpted below:

        Recent news releases from Uranium Energy Corp
        (OTCBB:URME) seems to indicate that the company is
        intent on adding to a uranium team considered by some
        to be the preeminent assemblage of uranium minds in the
        sector,'' stated SmallCap Sentinel analyst D.R. Clark.
        “In a geological field where credibility is imperative
        and leadership essential, URME appears to be as focused
        on the minds above the ground as the ore below it.”

        “Just yesterday, URME announced the appointment of
        Joshua Leftwich as Environmental Manager. Leftwich will
        be responsible for all permitting activities at the
        Company's 100% owned Goliad Project in South Texas,
        where production is forecast to begin by the third
        quarter of 2009,” Clark added. “URME’s team now
        includes experts that were integral to the
        environmental, permitting, and engineering of the
        recently opened Alta Mesa ISR Uranium Mine in Texas.”

                                 [Image]
        Uranium Energy Corp., "URME" is a US-based junior
        resource company with the objective of becoming a
        near-term ISL uranium producer in the United States.
        URME is developing its advanced-stage Goliad Project in
        South Texas, with ISL uranium production projected to
        begin in 2009.

        URME controls one of the largest historical uranium
        exploration and development databases in the U.S.
        Through the use of these databases, URME has acquired
        advanced uranium properties throughout the southwestern
        U.S. including Texas, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona,
        Colorado and Utah.  This region has historically been
        the most concentrated area for uranium mining in the
        US. With the use of historical exploration databases,
        URME has been able to target properties for acquisition
        that have already been the subject of significant
        exploration and development by senior energy companies
        in the past.

        The operational management is comprised of pre-eminent
        uranium mining and exploration professionals, whose
        collective experience in the uranium mining industry
        gives URME the ongoing uranium mine-finding and uranium
        mine development expertise.



                        Uranium price spiralling

                   April 02, 2007 02:15am - Article
                   from: The Advertiser   (Adelaide,
                   South Australia)

                   The spot price of uranium will
                   reach $US125 a pound this year
                   from its current $US95, Resource
                   Capital Research believes.  The
                   researcher monitors a broad range
                   of uranium hopefuls and actual
                   miners from Canada, Australia,
                   the U.S. and Britain.

                   It expects the price will touch
                   $US140 by September next year.

                   RCR's latest report on the global
                   uranium boom says "forward
                   indicators continue to strengthen
                   . . . with 48 new nuclear-power
                   reactors currently expected to be
                   commissioned globally by 2013".

                   It says the average share price
                   of the 140 junior Australian
                   companies it monitors had not
                   moved in the past month but those
                   prices had risen an average of 23
                   per cent over the past three
                   months and 122ve per cent over
                   the past year.

                   The researcher says the uranium
                   spot price is now 45 per cent
                   higher than three months ago and
                   78 per cent higher than its level
                   of $US53.25 a pound six months
                   ago.

                   RCR says it is confident this
                   month's national ALP conference
                   in Hobart will overturn the
                   party's "three-mines" policy.
                   That would benefit explorers in
                   South Australia and Queensland
                   the most.


        To date, URME has successfully acquired property
        containing 14.1 million pounds of historic uranium
        resources, with potential targets of 30.5 million
        pounds in additional resources being identified by the
        URME databases.

        URME's foundation project, located in Goliad County,
        Texas, has 5.2 million pounds of historic, uranium
        resources with potential targets of 10 million pounds
        in additional resources.  Development drilling and ISL
        mine permitting are ongoing with a view to commencing
        ISL uranium production in 2009.

                     America: The Next Uranium Giant

             The United States has 104 operating nuclear
             reactors generating more than 100 million
             megawatts of electricity each year, or
             approx. 20% of the country’s energy supply.
             These plants are using approximately 55
             million pounds of U3O8 annually to produce
             this energy.  The U.S. is by far the largest
             user of uranium in the world.

                              ABOUT URANIUM

                  Uranium is used primarily as an
                  energy source for nuclear fission
                  reactors - a safe, efficient, and
                  emission-free alternative to fossil
                  fuels. The market cycle for uranium
                  had been largely depressed since
                  1981, but has recently experienced
                  a sharp increase due to
                  macroeconomic factors.

                  An estimated supply shortfall of 80
                  million pounds per year, for
                  several coming years, is forecast
                  by measuring current annual reactor
                  demand and current annual mine
                  production. In addition, new
                  nuclear power plants have been
                  commissioned throughout the world;
                  China, India and Russia alone have
                  permitted the construction of over
                  75 new reactors.

                  In the United States, uranium
                  exploration has become a national
                  initiative. In August 2005,
                  President Bush signed into law the
                  Domenici-Barton Energy Policy Act
                  containing an array of provisions
                  that support nuclear power. This
                  enactment, combined with the
                  growing public recognition that
                  nuclear power plants generate
                  electricity with considerably less
                  greenhouse emission than fossil
                  fuels, places URME in a favorable
                  position for funding and exploring
                  all aspects of uranium development.

                      URME's Place in the Industry

             As in all mining of metals, there are stages
             of getting the ore out of the ground.
             Comparing all the 'players' in the uranium
             mining business, some are huge companies in
             full production (generally mining for Gold
             and Silver as well). The more medium sized
             companies are generally operating, but
             usually for less than a year and are
             considered in a start-up phase of mining.
             Most of the smaller companies are PLANNING TO
             DEVELOP OR DEVELOPING their uranium mining
             operations and this is the category that URME
             falls into.

              But there is a very significant difference...

             Peer competitors of URME include Uranerz
             Energy, UR-Energy, and Energy Metals. Not
             surprisingly, as with many SmallCap
             companies, the difference comes down to
             people and expertise.  URME has the most
             complete and experienced management and
             technical team when comes to building and
             operating ISL uranium mines in the U.S. and
             globally.  Add that to the fact that URME
             currently has the lowest market valuation
             compared to its immediate peers and its
             potential as a company and as a stock becomes
             quite clear.

                               -----------

                        INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS

                * Public for less than a year, URME holds
                  major industry trump card: Management
                  includes the ISL experts who earlier
                  built 80% of all current U.S. uranium
                  production facilities now in operation!

                * URME is now drilling with four rigs to
                  confirm and expand current 5.2 mm lb
                  historic uranium resource at Goliad, a
                  turn-key project in south Texas. Scoping
                  study for early production commences in
                  two months.

                * With 15 properties in six states,
                  controlling 13.4 mm lbs. historic
                  resource – and with significant
                  exploration databases from seven earlier
                  U3O8 explorers/producers – URME is
                  rapidly expanding its resources so
                  production can ramp up quickly.

                * The industry was last vital in the
                  mid-70s to early-80s – 20 to 30 years
                  ago. This fact directly highlights a
                  major strategic advantage held by
                  Uranium Energy Corp. This company has
                  successfully brought on seven such
                  professionals, headed by two of the
                  biggest hitters in the North American
                  uranium mining industry: Harry Anthony
                  and Spie Norris. In terms of in-situ
                  leaching, or ISL uranium production,
                  there is no stronger engineering team.

        Tuesday April 10, 9:00 am ET

                Uranium Energy Corp to Acquire Additional
                        Past-Producing Uranium
               and Vanadium Mines on the Colorado Plateau

         Acquisition Expands Company's Holdings Contiguous To US
                  Department of Energy Uranium Reserve

        AUSTIN, TEXAS--(MARKET WIRE)--Apr 10, 2007 -- Uranium
        Energy Corp (OTC BB:URME.OB - News)(Frankfurt:U6Z.F -
        News)(Berlin:U6Z.BE - News) announces that it has
        entered into an agreement to acquire approximately
        5,000 acres in the Uravan Mineral Belt of the Colorado
        Plateau, in the states of Colorado and Utah. This
        acquisition compliments the Company's existing
        properties in this significant uranium- and
        vanadium-producing region.

        The Uravan Mineral Belt is the oldest uranium mining
        area in the United States. This geological trend arcs
        across the west central Colorado counties of Mesa,
        Montrose and San Miguel, and into northeastern Utah.
        Both uranium ores averaging 0.25% and vanadium ores
        averaging 1.7% are produced in the region from
        sandstone deposits, primarily in the Salt Wash Member
        of the Morrison Formation.

        This property was the subject of significant uranium
        exploration, and includes the sites of several
        past-producing uranium and vanadium mines. Some of the
        formerly-producing uranium mines within the property
        boundary include the Sandy, Babe Ruth, Bald Eagle, Fawn
        Springs #5, and Teapot Dome mines. The aggregate
        production from these mines was over 400,000 pounds of
        uranium, and nearly 2.4 million pounds of vanadium.
        Grades of production in each case were close to the
        average for the mineral belt.

        The sites of the historical production are in close
        proximity to Uranium Energy Corp's existing properties,
        which are also the sites of historically-producing
        mines, and share mineral trends with those former
        mines. For example, the Babe Ruth Mine is 4 miles east
        of the Company's Raven Mine Project in Colorado. One
        area of the property is also contiguous to Cotter
        Corporation's large open pit and decline located on the
        US Department of Energy Uranium Reserve.

        A preliminary geological field assessment of all the
        properties was conducted last week by Company
        geologists, and was positive. The potential for
        development of uranium and vanadium resources has been
        indicated. Based on the assessment, certain areas have
        been given exploration priority. The Company is also
        pursuing the acquisition of additional uranium
        production and exploration data covering the property,
        with data for certain target areas being prioritized.
        It is anticipated that the historic uranium resource
        estimates will be available upon closing, which is
        expected to occur within 30 days. Drill permitting will
        be initiated immediately following the closing, with a
        view to carrying out delineation and step-out drilling.

                 Sandstone Uranium Mines in New Mexico

         New Acquisition to Yield Significant Historical Uranium
            Resources, and Prior Mining and Exploration Data

        AUSTIN, TEXAS--(MARKET WIRE)--Apr 3, 2007 -- Uranium
        Energy Corp (OTC BB:URME.OB - News)(Frankfurt:U6Z.F -
        News)(Berlin:U6Z.BE - News) has entered into an
        agreement with Spider Rock Mining, a private company,
        to acquire 8,500 acres under the administration of the
        U.S. Bureau of Land Management within the heart of the
        Ambrosia Lake Mining District, in the state of New
        Mexico. As part of the agreement, the Company will also
        acquire historic production information covering most
        of the property. The agreement is subject to a 30-day
        due diligence period.

        The acquisition is the site of over 8.5 million pounds
        of historical underground uranium production, primarily
        from the Ann Lee and Sandstone Mines, and is contiguous
        to the current uranium resource holdings of BHP
        Billiton. The Ambrosia Lake District includes some of
        the largest past-producing uranium mines in the U.S.,
        operated at the time by Kerr McGee (now Andarko
        Petroleum), Homestake Mining (now Barrick Gold),
        Phillips Petroleum (now Conoco Phillips), and United
        Nuclear Corp. A substantial amount of production,
        development and exploration work has been completed on
        this property by these companies.

<p>Dear StockUpTicks Reader:
<p><font color="#000000">After a significant quiet period and retreat in
the company's stock price, we're pleased to be able to reintroduce one
of our top performing equities in StockUpTicks.com’s seven year history.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">With the <b>uranium spot price</b> (<b>$135+</b>)

one of the hottest, if not the hottest, sectors of the market.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">And if you're wondering why <b>URME</b> retreated
in price during the quiet period, two analysts have offered their measured

<p>Recent news releases from <b>Uranium Energy Corp (OTCBB:URME)</b> seems
to indicate that the company is intent on adding to a uranium team considered
by some to be the preeminent assemblage of uranium minds in the sector,''
stated SmallCap Sentinel analyst D.R. Clark. “In a geological field where
credibility is imperative and leadership essential, URME appears to be
as focused on the minds above the ground as the ore below it.”
<p>“Just yesterday, URME announced the appointment of Joshua Leftwich as
Environmental Manager. Leftwich will be responsible for all permitting
activities at the Company's 100% owned Goliad Project in South Texas, where
production is forecast to begin by the third quarter of 2009,” Clark added.
“URME’s team now includes experts that were integral to the environmental,
permitting, and engineering of the recently opened Alta Mesa ISR Uranium
Mine in Texas.”

<p><b><font color="#000000">Uranium is used primarily as an energy source
for nuclear fission reactors - a safe, efficient, and emission-free alternative
to fossil fuels. The market cycle for uranium had been largely depressed
since 1981, but has recently experienced a sharp increase due to macroeconomic
factors.&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">An estimated supply shortfall of 80 million
pounds per year, for several coming years, is forecast by measuring current
annual reactor demand and current annual mine production. In addition,
new nuclear power plants have been commissioned throughout the world; China,
India and Russia alone have permitted <u>the construction of over 75 new
reactors.&nbsp;</u></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">In the United States, </font><font color="#004080">uranium
exploration has become a national initiative</font><font color="#000000">.
In August 2005, President Bush signed into law the Domenici-Barton Energy
Policy Act containing an array of provisions that support nuclear power.
This enactment, combined with the growing public recognition that nuclear
power plants generate electricity <u>with considerably less greenhouse
emission than fossil fuels,</u> places URME in a favorable position for

ore out of the ground. Comparing all the 'players' in the uranium mining
business, some are huge companies in full production (generally mining
for Gold and Silver as well). The more medium sized companies are generally
operating, but usually for less than a year and are considered in a start-up
phase of mining. Most of the smaller companies are <b><font color="#004080"><font size=-1>PLANNING

<blockquote><font color="#000000">Peer competitors of URME include Uranerz

WIRE)--Apr 10, 2007 -- Uranium Energy Corp (OTC BB:URME.OB - News)(Frankfurt:U6Z.F

announces that it has entered into an agreement to acquire approximately
5,000 acres in the Uravan Mineral Belt of the Colorado Plateau, in the
states of Colorado and Utah. This acquisition compliments the Company's
existing properties in this significant uranium- and vanadium-producing
region.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>The Uravan Mineral Belt
is the oldest uranium mining area in the United States. This geological
trend arcs across the west central Colorado counties of Mesa, Montrose
and San Miguel, and into northeastern Utah. Both uranium ores averaging
0.25% and vanadium ores averaging 1.7% are produced in the region from
sandstone deposits, primarily in the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>This property was the
subject of significant uranium exploration, and includes the sites of several
past-producing uranium and vanadium mines. Some of the formerly-producing
uranium mines within the property boundary include the Sandy, Babe Ruth,
Bald Eagle, Fawn Springs #5, and Teapot Dome mines. The aggregate production
from these mines was over 400,000 pounds of uranium, and nearly 2.4 million
pounds of vanadium. Grades of production in each case were close to the
average for the mineral belt.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>The sites of the historical
production are in close proximity to Uranium Energy Corp's existing properties,
which are also the sites of historically-producing mines, and share mineral
trends with those former mines. For example, the Babe Ruth Mine is 4 miles
east of the Company's Raven Mine Project in Colorado. One area of the property
is also contiguous to Cotter Corporation's large open pit and decline located
on the US Department of Energy Uranium Reserve.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>A preliminary geological
field assessment of all the properties was conducted last week by Company
geologists, and was positive. The potential for development of uranium
and vanadium resources has been indicated. Based on the assessment, certain
areas have been given exploration priority. The Company is also pursuing
the acquisition of additional uranium production and exploration data covering
the property, with data for certain target areas being prioritized. It
is anticipated that the historic uranium resource estimates will be available
upon closing, which is expected to occur within 30 days. Drill permitting
will be initiated immediately following the closing, with a view to carrying
out delineation and step-out drilling.</font></font>
