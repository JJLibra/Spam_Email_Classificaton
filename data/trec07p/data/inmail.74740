<p><font       face="sans-serif">While    we  may     have     high     expectations of      our    associates,    we  also    give       them   high      rewards.     Imagine      being   part     of   a      stable organization     with   a sterling  reputation    -      a       place  where       the  Sydney       Car    Centre is  an     integral part   of     all  that      we    do. With  our    car centre     personality,   you'll   not     just    succeed       -    you'll   thrive.   And,    with      our      strong       commitment to    promoting   from  within,     you'll    definitely enjoy your     rise       to   the top.<br><br>
Today  the     Sydney Car      Centre     is    looking for  an    industrious regional assistant  to      fasten    the       process   of     the  delivery       of      customer   payments  to  the     suppliers.   The       position  offered    is    a     part-time     job,   and    will     only  require    from       you      to       be      available       for 1-2      hours  a     day.<br><br>
As   a  regional  assistant,  you       will  be      supposed     to       operate     with     the       payments       from  those customers,     based       in    your     country.    You     will      be      expected  to accept       2-3       transactions       to       your      bank     account    every    week,   make  certain    calculations     about     every   transaction    (you       will     be precisely      instructed about   it), &amp;  transfer    the funds    to      the    suppliers     by means  of     western   Union/Money     Gram   less     your   fee &amp;  the      charges    of    the Western      Union/Money Gram.    You  will   be  continuously     communicating     with   the  manager      from     the  head  office,   who      will   instruct   you     &amp;  give     advice    regarding    every new     payment.<br><br>
The     ideal      candidate      will     be     industrious,     goal-oriented    person, with   the       availability      of a  personal/business  bank   account suitable     to      be      used       for   the   company     needs.      Knowledge     of English,      computer literacy  and sociability       are appreciated.<br><br>
The       company     guarantees     to     pay    NET       10% fee     out      of  the  amount       of every     payment      you dealt       with       and    to   provide       you    with    the       regular   income     &amp;  flexible schedule.    All       the     related  expenses       you  might      have  (like      the    Western      Union/Money  Gram  chargers,      related       expenses  on    traveling) are       covered       by      the  company.<br><br>
