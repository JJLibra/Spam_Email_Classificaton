 1000    one thousand   is the natural number following 999 and preceding 1001.

In mathematics  The decimal representation for one thousand is    1,000      a
one followed by three zeroes, in the general notation nbsp      1   
10 sup 3 /sup       in engineering notation, which for this number coincides
with nbsp      1    10 sup 3 /sup   exactly     in scientific normalized
exponential notation nbsp      1 E+3  exactly     in scientific E notation.  The
SI prefix for a thousand is  [[kilo]]  , officially abbreviated as  k      for
instance prefixed to [[metre]] or its abbreviation m, kilometre or km signifies
a thousand metres nbsp     as such technically oriented people occasionally
represent the number in a non standard notation by replacing the last three
zeroes of the general numeral with  k , for instance 30 k for 30,000  The sum of
Euler s totient function over the first 57 integers is 1000.

In time  A millennium has 1000 years. The year 1000 is the last year of the
first millennium AD.

In popular culture
  In music, [[Thousand  single  Thousand]] is a 1993 techno single by Moby.
  A grand is a slang term in English for one thousand units of a given currency.
  Several grand can be shortened to G s.    Especially in the U.S.A., the
  gambling community often refers to denominations of $1000 as [[dime
   slang  dimes]].

Trivia To count to one thousand, counting one number every second continuously
would take 16 minutes and 40 seconds.

Watchung, from the 1900/s was a semi/

rural small community of about 3,200 people
in comparison with the relatively much larger 

and wealthier cities of Plainfield
and Somerville. Even as late as the 1960/s, it was comm

on for residents to know
one another by name, with few moving in or out of the town. the 1

967 Plainfield
riots caused an exodus of the large upper/middle class population to move t

o the
Watchung Hills including Watchung, Warren Township and Bridgewater Township. It
was 

at this time that Watchung became a bedroom community and the average income
and median ho

use prices soared.
