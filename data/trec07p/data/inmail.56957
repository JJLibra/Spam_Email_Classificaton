We are going to increase the amounts of transfers in future and your profit will be $2000, and in 5 months it will be $3000.

The work of an escrow agent 
As the basis of our service is to provide escrow deals on the Internet we need escrow agents all over the world. Attracting clients from different corners of the world we should have our agents everywhere so that to be able to provide instant escrow solutions (in-state bank transfers take no more than a few hours). We engage new technologies to deal with the e-document exchange, which make the process reliable and safe. Our service only deals with the paperwork, leaving the financial part (accepting funds on your personal bank accounts from the buyers, and routing them to the sellers according to our instructions afterwards) for you. We can’t shoulder the financial responsibility because in today's world of extremely fast solutions it is time that is of extreme importance to our clients. Having an escrow agent in every country we can quickly transfer funds inside the country without wasting time on the international bank transfers, and continue our rapid growth rather than overwhelming our own bank account with inbound and outbound transactions leading to severe hold times and probably service interruption. 
Your main task will be accepting money transactions on your personal bank accounts and routing them to other bank account of the escrow process, according to our instructions. You will benefit from the commissions, which are 5-7% of every transaction and depend on the quantity of completed transactions and the speed of your work. For your convenience there will be no paychecks, your commission will remain in your account, which is activated after your registration, after every successfully completed transaction. The cost of money transfer is not included in your commission, meaning you will deduct it from the amount to be sent, not your commission. And you receive 5-7% of the amount of the transaction. Normally the amounts that we process vary from $5,000 to $35,000, but can go higher on special occasions 
Types of Transactions 
The main type of escrow transactions as far as the financial part is concerned are direct bank transfers - ACH, cheques and wire transfers . There is one more way - to deal with the old-fashioned checks, but we are cautious about it and usually require upfront approval from you before proceeding with this method. So in brief, you can make money transfer of any type of listed above. 
 
In case you refuse to incorporate, feel free to use your personal accounts for check-enabled escrow transactions (where the buyer remits payment to escrow via personal or corporate check). Please note escrow service will only proceed once the check clears and the hold will be removed from the check amount by your bank for complete and unrestricted use of deposited funds! 
Protection from Fraud 
Due to the nature of our business we have to aggressively struggle against fraud and spot it at the earliest stages to manage to provide continuity and safety of the escrow process. We treat the security of our agents, clients and our own one seriously! We screen out potential escrow clients by means of the most robust and complicated screening systems, including but not limited to TeleCheck (verifying funds availability on the written checks as well as previous positive payment history - only in case of check originated transaction), ChoicePoint (verifying client's personal information) and LexisNexis (revealing previous criminal activities). As far as escrow agent application is concerned, we sometimes have to ask you fax your ID if necessary.
Taxation 
According to US laws you are not required to pay taxes on bank transactions. In addition to that, generally you will not have to do your work under your own name, but the name of your company. If you insist we can prepare and file all tax documents with the IRS at the end of fiscal year.
