Anatrim
 The most powerful fat loss blend available anywhere! 

What is Anatrim ?
 If you haven't heard of Anatrim yet, you soon will because it is being touted as the new miracle supplement for safe, effective weight loss. Anatrim zombieii, (Anatrim) is the botanical name for a cactus like plant that grows in Southern Africa. Scientists have recently isolated several compounds in this amazing plant that are responsible for dramatic weight loss. This all-natural appetite suppressant is also being applauded for containing no dangerous stimulants that caused adverse side effects associated with weight loss products of the last decade.

How does Anatrim work?
 It basically tricks the brain into thinking that you're full. The chemical constituents in Anatrim work within the satiety center by releasing a chemical compound similar to glucose but much stronger. The hypothalamus in the brain receives this signal as an indication that enough food has been consumed and this in turn stunts the appetite.

"I was originally amazed that the first two pills I took of Anatrim, almost immediately took my cravings away. Now 4 weeks later, 3 belt holes later, I have become an advocate for this awesomely powerful, natural supplement!"             Jennifer L., Iowa I tried Anatrim after visiting your website, and I lost a few pounds without doing anything else. I was so amazed I decided to start exercising and getting outside more and I even starting eating better. Now I don't even look like the same man. Friends I haven't seen for more than a year don't even recognize me. The change is that dramatic! Thank you Anatrim really works!        Steve Richter, Texas"WOW! My wife and I been on roller coater diets for years and years. It has been a frustrating ride I have to admit. Your product helped us to lose 64 lbs between us in 2 months. That was 6 months ago and the weight is still off! Thank you, thank you, thank you....did we say Thank you!!"    Linda C., Bellevue WA
