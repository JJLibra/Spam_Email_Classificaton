<b><pre style="font-size: 12px;">
I am 62 and had a heart attack 12 years ago. I keep myself fit and I have been using Viagra for 3 years. <br>
I prefer taking small amounts --. half or even less of a 25mg tablet, This amount works on an empty stomach <br>
with half a glass of water. I occasionally take about 20mgs - then wow, I want to go on for hours! I have tried<br>
 taking 25mg and 50mg at one time but I find it is too much and reduces the sensations. It is a sensational product!<br>
