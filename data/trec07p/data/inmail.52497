Greetings in the name of God. Please let this not sound strange to you for my only surviving lawyer who would have done this died early this year. I prayed and got you email id from your country’s chambers of commerce which I have been with my late husband and liked to visit once more if God will in his infinite mercies.
I am Mrs.Teresa Bunkall from England am 51 years old, I am deaf and suffering from a long time cancer of the breast , from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating and it is quite obvious that, according to my doctors they have advised me that I may not live for the next two months, this is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage. I was brought up from a motherless babies home was married to my late husband for twenty years without a child, died in a fatal motor accident. Before his death we were true Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited belongings and deposited all the sum of $12million dollars with a Security Company.
Presently, this money is still with them and the management just wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive the money for keeping it so long or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I can not come over because of my illness or they get it confisticated. Presently, I'm with my laptop in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer of the breast.I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live.
It is my last wish to see that this money is invested to any organization of your choice and distributed each year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless baby’s home where I come from. I want you God fearing, to also use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows.
I took this decision, before I rest in peace because my time will soon be up. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security Company. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the new beneficiary of my fund. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Please reply to my personal address (teresakall1@yahoo.fr)
Hoping to hearing from you soon.
 
Yours in Christ,
Sister Teresa Bunkall.
