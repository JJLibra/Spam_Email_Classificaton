      This page is about the university system across Massachusetts. The
[[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] was known as the University of
Massachusetts from 1947 until the creation of the UMass system.  See Middlesex
University  Massachusetts  for a private institution named the  University of
Massachusetts  which operated from 1917 until 1937, when it merged with
Middlesex College to form Middlesex University.  br  The  University of
Massachusetts   officially nicknamed  UMass   is the five campus public
university system of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

The system includes UMass Amherst, UMass Boston, UMass Dartmouth  affiliated
with Cape Cod Community College , UMass Lowell, and the UMass Medical School. It
also has an online school called UMassOnline.

Campuses UMass Amherst

UMass Amherst is the flagship and the largest of the UMass campuses. It was also
the first campus established. Like many colleges and universities,
 Massachusetts Agricultural College   as it was called  the Amherst campus was
founded as a land grant college in 1863, receiving initial start up funding as
part of the Morrill Land Grant Colleges Act. It is part of the Five College
consortium in the Pioneer Valley region. It became  Massachusetts State College 
in 1937, and  University of Massachusetts  in 1947.

UMass Boston

On the Columbia Point peninsula of Boston s Dorchester neighborhood, UMass
Boston is the youngest of the campuses, beginning in 1964.

UMass Dartmouth

Located in southeastern Massachusetts, UMass Dartmouth started in 1895 as the
 New Bedford Textile School  and the  Bradford Durfee Textile School .

UMass Lowell

Located in the Merrimack Region, UMass Lowell started in 1894 as the  Lowell
Normal School  and in 1895 as the  Lowell Textile School .

UMass Medical

Located in Worcester, Massachusetts, UMass Medical was founded in 1962 and is
affiliated with the UMass Memorial Health Care system.

University President From 1996 to 2003, the President of the University was
William Bulger, president of the Massachusetts State Senate for seventeen years,
and prominent and influential Democratic politician with roots in South Boston.
Bulger became involved in court testimony about his notorious brother, Whitey
Bulger. He was forced to resign after a sustained campaign for his ouster by
former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.

The President of the University from the Fall of 2004 has been Jack Wilson,
former CEO of UMassOnline and interim President of the University after the
departure of William
Bulger. ref [http //www.uml.edu/newsroom/magazine/fall2004.pdf Campus News]

See text. // /Lungfishes/ are freshwater fish belonging to the order Dipnoi.
Lungfish are

 best/known for retaining characteristics primitive within the
Osteichthyes, including the

 ability to breathe air, and structures primitive
within Sarcopterygii, including the pres

ence of lobed fins with a well/developed
internal skeleton. Today, they live only in Afric

a, South America, and
Australia. While vicariance would suggest this represents an ancient


distribution limited to the Mesozoic supercontinent Gondwana, the fossil record
suggests 

that advanced lungfish had a cosmopolitan freshwater distribution and
that the current dis

tribution of modern lungfish species reflects extinction of
many lineages following the br

eakup of both Pangea and subsequently Gondwana and
Laurasia.

Anatomy and Morphology All l

ungfish demonstrate an uninterrupted cartilaginous
notochord and an extensively developed 

palatal dentition. Basal lungfish groups
may retain marginal teeth and an ossified brainca

se, but derived lungfish taxa,
including all modern species, show a significant reduction 

in marginal bones and
a cartilaginous braincase. The bones of the skull roof in primitive 

lungfish are
covered in a mineralized tissue called cosmine, but in post/devonian lungfish

es,
the skull roof is subdermal and the cosmine covering is lost. All modern
lungfish show

 significant reductions and fusions of the bones of the skull roof,
and the specific bones

 of the skull roof show no homology to the skull roof
bones of actinopterygiians or tetrap

ods.

The dentition of lungfish is conspicuously different from that of any other
vertebra

te group. Odontodes on the palate and lower jaws develop in a series of
rows to form a fan

/shaped occlusion surface. These odontodes then wear to form a
uniform crushing surface. I

n several groups, including the modern
lepidosireniformes, these ridges have been modified

 to form occluding blades.

The modern lungfishes have a number of larval features, which 

suggest
paedomorphosis. They also demonstrate the largest genome among the vertebrates.

M

odern lungfish all have an elongate body with fleshy paired pectoral and pelvic
fins and a

 single unpaired caudal fin replacing the dorsal, caudal, and anal fin
of most fishes.

Ec

ology and Life History Behavior African and South American lungfish are
capable of survivi

ng seasonal desiccation of habitats by burrowing into mud and
estivating throughout the dr

y season. Changes in physiology allow the lungfish
to slow its metabolism to as little as 

1/60th of the normal metabolic rate, and
protein waste is converted from ammonia to less/t

oxic urea /normally, lungfish
excrete nitrogenous waste as ammonia directly into the water

/. Burrowing is seen
in at least one group of fossil lungfish, the Gnathorhizidae. It has 

been
proposed both that burrowing is plesiomorphic for lungfish as well as that
gnathorhiz

ids are directly ancestral to modern Lepidosireniformes, but it is
possible that the simil

arity is simply due to convergent evolution or parallel
evolution.

Taxonomic History Taxo

nomy of lungfishes can be viewed in terms of taxonomic
position of lungfishes within Ostei

chthyes and taxonomic relationships within
lungfishes.

The former is well/resolved. In a 

cladogram of osteichthyan relationships,
lungfishes clade closest with [[Powichthyes]], an

d then with the Porolepiformes.
Together, these taxa form the Dipnomorpha. The dipnomorpha

 form a sister group
to the tetrapodomorpha. Together, these are known as the Rhipidistia,

 and form a
sister group to the coelacanths.

The latter is significantly more difficult t

o resolve. While Devonian lungfish
retain enough ossification of the endocranium to determ

ine relationships, post/
Devonian lungfish are represented entirely by skull roofs and tee

th, as the rest
of the skull is cartilaginous. Additionally, many of the taxa that have be

en
identified may not be monophyletic. Current phylogenetic studies support the
following
