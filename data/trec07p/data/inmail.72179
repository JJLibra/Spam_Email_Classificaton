The  Western Tanager , Piranga ludoviciana, is a medium sized songbird of the
Tanager family,  Thraupidae .

Adults have pale stout pointed bills, yellow underparts and light wing bars.
Adult males have a bright red face and a yellow nape, shoulder, and rump, with
black upper back, wings, and tail  in non breeding plumage the head has no more
than a reddish cast and the body has an olive tinge. Females have a yellow head
and are olive on the back, with dark wings and tail.

The song of disconnected short phrases suggests an American Robin s but is
hoarser and rather monotonous. The call is described as  pit er ick .

Their breeding habitat is coniferous or mixed woods across western North America
from the U.S. Mexican border as far north as southern Alaska  thus they are the
northernmost breeding tanager. They build a flimsy cup nest on a horizontal tree
branch, usually in a conifer. They lay four bluish green eggs with brown spots.

These birds migrate, wintering from central Mexico to Costa Rica. Some also
winter in southern California.

These birds are often out of sight, foraging high in trees, sometimes flying out
to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat insects, fruits and berries. At
times they offer spectacular views, and in much of their range, when a non 
birder tells a birder,  I saw the most amazing bird   the birder can guess it
was a male of this species.

/Apache/ is the collective name for several culturally related groups of Native
Amer

icans in the United States.

These indigenous peoples of North America speak a Southern At

habaskan /Apachean/
language. The modern term Apache excludes the related Navajo people. H

owever,
the Navajo and the other Apache groups are clearly related through culture and
lan

guage and thus are considered /Apachean/. Apachean peoples formerly ranged
over eastern Ar

izona, north/western Mexico, New Mexico, parts of Texas, and a
small group on the plains.



There was little political unity among the Apachean groups. The groups spoke 7
different 

languages. The current division of Apachean groups includes the
Navajo, Western Apache, Ch

iricahua, Mescalero, Jicarilla, Lipan, and Plains
Apache /formerly Kiowa/Apache/. Apache g

roups are now in Oklahoma and Texas and
on reservations in Arizona and New Mexico. The Nav

ajo reside on a large
reservation in the United States. Some Apacheans have moved to large


metropolitan areas, such as New York City.

The Apachean tribes were historically very po

werful, constantly at enmity with
the whites for centuries. The U.S. Army, in their variou

s confrontations, found
them to be fierce warriors and skillful strategists.

Name and syn

onymy Name

The word Apache entered English via Spanish, but the ultimate origin is
uncert

ain. The first known written record in Spanish is by Juan de O//ate in
1598. The most wide

ly accepted origin theory suggests it was borrowed from the
Zuni word that refers to /Nava

jos/. It is interesting to note that modern Zuni
words identify Apache groups such as /Whi

te Mountain Apache/ and /San Carlos
Apache, Apaches in general// and have this one word fo

r the Navajo. Another
theory suggests the term comes from Yavapai meaning /people/. It is 

likely that
O//ate did not use the name in Spanish for the first time because several
Span

ish groups had contact with Zuni pueblos in 1539/41. Other possible origins
may be from Sp

anish mapache /raccoon/ and from an unspecified Quechan word
meaning /running warrior hors

e/.

The Spanish first use the term /Apachu de Nabajo/ /Navajo/ in the 1620s,
referring to

 people in the Chama region east of the San Juan River. By the
1640s, the term was applied

 to Southern Athabaskan peoples from the Chama on the
east to the San Juan on the west.

T

he tribes tenacity and fighting skills, probably bolstered by dime novels, had
an impact o

n Europeans. In early twentieth century Parisian society Apache
essentially meant an outla

w.

/Difficulties in naming/ Many written historical names of Apachean groups
recorded by 

non/Apacheans are difficult to match to modern/day tribes or their
sub groups. Many Spanis

h, French or English speaking authors over the centuries
did not distinguish between Apach

ean and other semi/nomadic non/Apachean peoples
that might pass through the same area. Mor

e commonly a name was acquired through
a tr
