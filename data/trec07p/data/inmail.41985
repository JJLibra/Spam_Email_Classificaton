However, I had learnt to love. She taught me how to. I could fill her with love; touching her eyes with mine, ploughing my fingers in her hair, whispering my laughter in her ears. She would spread her tiny little complains with her head on my shoulder. We would aimlessly talk while walking on a deserted road in a tranquil evening. I would sing her songs in my gauche voice and she would disperse her melodious laughter in the air. I had planned everything. And along with this, I had also saved enough money to fulfill many of her not innocent wishes.

Our intention is to offer to only those interested. If not the mechanizim is in place for you to decide.
