FROM THE DESK OF:MR.BRIAN CAPON
NATIONAL WESTMINISTER BANK,
LONDON,
UNITED KINGDOM.

Dear Friend,

I am Mr.Brian Capon the system and control director at the NATIONAL
WESTMINISTER BANK.I am writing this letter to solicit for support and
assistance from you to carry out this business opportunity in my bank.

Lying in an inactive account is the sum of 11million pounds sterling
belonging to a foreign customer(Michael Gambone) who was a gas consultant
here in UK,who happens to be deceased during a business trip. He died with
his wife(Deborah Gambone) on board the Swissair Flight 111 , which crashed
into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia in september 2nd 1998.
The news of this crash was on the news which we have notified his
relatives to no avail.See links below for more detail information:

http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/
http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/08/swissair.02/

Ever since he died the bank has been expecting his next of kin to come and
claim these fund. To this effect, we can not release the money unless
someone applies for it as next of kin, as indicated in our banking
guideline.Unfortunately he has no family member in UK or Over-sea who are
aware of the existence of the money(as he was a gas consultant.
At this juncture i have decided to do business with you by soliciting your
assistance in applying as the next of kin to the bank then the money will
be released to you,as I do not want this money to go into the bank
treasury as an unclaimed bill,because the banking law and guideline
stipulates that if such money(s) remains unclaimed  for a period of up to
nine years(9yrs),the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as
an unclaimed bill.
My request for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that
the customer was a foreigner and a British cannot stand as next of kin.

50% of the money will be your share as a foreign partner and your
assistance to actualise this business,thereafter i will visit your country
with your help once the money hits your account for disbursement according
to the percentage indicated.
To effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed,you must
apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the deceased,then we will
follow up all formalities for the transaction.

Upon receipt of your reply, i will send to you, the text of the
application you are to send to the bank,and further clearify you in other
issues as to effect this business.
Awaiting to hear from you urgently.

Best Regards
Mr.Brian Capon.
