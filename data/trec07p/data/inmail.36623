Concerning SP.AM.

My name is Cheryl-Ann Porter and I am an Internet Marketing Professional.
Over the years I have developed an email list comprised of millions of emails 
of people that have shown interest in learning how to make money via the 
Internet on their computers.

Due to the recent developments with anti spam laws, I am going through my 
lists and cleaning them. If you do NOT wish to receive any offers from me or 
any of my partners, please follow the delist instructions below this email. 

I will be sa^d to see you go, but I will NOT send email to anyone that doesn't 
want it in their inbox. That just wastes your time and mine. 

I have ma^de no attempt to hide who I am, nor have a I ma^de it impossible 
to contact me. To delist from future mailings, please click on the delist link 
below. If you do decide to stay on the Ho^me Based Business Help Mailing 
List, you can unsu^bscribe quickly and easily anytime by using the delist link 
at the bottom of any email. Easy.

Should you wish to remain on my list, I will provide you with my contact details 
as well, so you can a^dd me to yours.  I believe in networking and building 
relationships in business.  It's also neat to meet people from all over the world. 
I love what I do, and if you'd like, I can show you several different programs that 
can earn you money, or not. Maybe I'll want to know more about yours.

I will also be sending out:
FR^EE marketing downloa^ds to help you market your business
FR^EE ebooks, tools, and training
FR^EE a^dvertising resources
Special offers that only members receive that you won't want to miss
and tons more that I won't list here...

Either way, I wish you every success in all your endeavors.

Best Regards,

Cheryl-Ann Porter
