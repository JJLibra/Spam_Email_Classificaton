<STYLE>
The  Minoans  were a civilization in Crete in the Aegean Sea. Ceramic items
created during the Neolithic period in Crete date to 7000 BC and the height of
the Minoan culture flourished from approximately 2700 to 1450 BC when their
culture was superseded by the Mycenaean culture. The Minoans were one of the
civilizations that flourished in and around the Mediterranean during the Bronze
Age of Greece. These civilizations had much contact with each other, sometimes
making it difficult to judge the extent to which the Minoans influenced, or were
influenced by, their neighbors. Based on depictions in Minoan art, Minoan
culture is often characterized as a matrilineal society centered on goddess
worship.

Minoan Palaces, such as the one at Knossos, were technologically advanced 
expanded drainage systems, aqueducts, and deep wells that provided fresh water
to the inhabitants. The palaces were multi storied and contained interior and
exterior staircases, light wells, massive columns, storage magazines, and
courtyards.

The term  Minoan  was coined by the British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans after
the mythic  king  Minos associated with the labyrinth, which Evans identified as
the site at Knossos. It is not known whether  Minos  was a personal name or a
title. What the Minoans called themselves is unknown, although the Egyptian
place name  Keftiu    kaft  w  and the Semitic  Kaftor  or  Caphtor  and
 Kaptara  in the Mari archives apparently refers to the island of Crete.

Much later, the Odyssey calls the non Greek speaking natives of Crete
Eteocretans meaning,  true Cretans .

Chronology and history



Rather than give calendar dates for the Minoan period, archaeologists use two
systems of relative chronology. The first, created by Evans and modified by
later archaeologists, is based on pottery styles. It divides the Minoan period
into three main eras mdash Early Minoan  EM , Middle Minoan  MM , and Late
Minoan  LM . These eras are further subdivided, e.g. Early Minoan I, II, III
 EMI, EMII, EMIII . Another dating system, proposed by the Greek archaeologist
Nicolas Platon, is based on the development of the architectural complexes known
as  palaces  at Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Kato Zakros, and divides the
Minoan period into Prepalatial, Protopalatial, Neopalatial, and Post palatial
periods. The relationship among these systems is given in the accompanying
table, with approximate calendar dates drawn from Warren and Hankey  1989 .

All calendar dates given in this article are approximate, and the subject of
ongoing debate.

The Thera eruption occurred during a mature phase of the LM IA period. The
calendar date of the volcanic eruption is extremely controversial  see the
article on Thera eruption for discussion. It often is identified as a
catastrophic natural event for the culture, leading to its rapid collapse,
perhaps being related mythically as Atlantis by Classical Greeks.

The oldest signs of inhabitants on Crete are ceramic Neolithic remains that date
to approximately 7000 BC. See History of Crete for details.

The beginning of its Bronze Age, around 2600 BC, was a period of great unrest in
Crete, and also marks the beginning of Crete as an important center of
civilization.

At the end of the MMII period  1700 BC  there was a large disturbance in Crete,
probably an earthquake, or possibly an invasion from Anatolia. The Palaces at
Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Kato Zakros were destroyed. But with the start of
the Neopalatial period, population increased again, the palaces were rebuilt on
a larger scale and new settlements were built all over the island. This period
 the seventeenth and sixteenth centuries BC, MM III / Neopalatial  represents
the apex of the Minoan civilization. The Thera eruption occurred during LMIA
 and LHI .

On the Greek mainland, LHIIB began during LMIB, showing independence from Minoan
influence. At the end of the LMIB period, the Minoan palace culture failed
catastrophically. All palaces were destroyed, and only Knossos was immediately
restored   although other palaces sprang up later in LMIIIA  like Chania .

LMIB ware has been found in Egypt under the reigns of Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis
III. Either the LMIB/LMII catastrophe occurred after this time, or else it was
so bad that the Egyptians then had to import LHIIB instead.

/Watermelon/ /Citrullus lanatus, Family Cucurbitaceae/ is both a fruit and 

a
vegetable/ref/National Watermelon Promotional Board, /Watermelon Facts/, pg.
1//ref/ and

 plant of a vine/like /climber and trailer/ herb originally from
southern Africa and one o

f the most common type of melon. This flowering plant
produces a special type of fruit kno

wn by botanists as a pepo, which has a thick
rind /exocarp/ and fleshy center /mesocarp an

d endocarp// pepos are derived from
an inferior ovary and are characteristic of the Cucurb

itaceae. The watermelon
fruit, loosely considered a type of melon /although not in the gen

us
[[Cucumis]]/, has a smooth exterior rind /green and yellow/ and a juicy, sweet,
usually

 red or yellow, but sometimes orange, interior flesh. The flesh consists
of highly develop

ed placental tissue within the fruit. The former name Citrullus
vulgaris /vulgaris meaning

 /common/ /mdash/ Shosteck, 1974/, is now a synonym of
the accepted scientific name for wa

termelon, Citrullus lanatus. History

David Livingstone, an explorer of Africa, described 

watermelon as abundant in
the Kalahari Desert, where it is believed to have originated. Th

ere, the
ancestral melon grows wild and is known as the /Tsamma/ melon /Citrullus lanatus


var citroides/. It is recognizable by its pinnatifid leaves and prolific fruit,
up to 100 

melons on a single vine. For this reason it is a popular source of
water in the diet of th

e indigenous people. The flesh is similar to the rind of
a watermelon and is often known a

s citron melon /distinct from the actual
citron, of the citrus family// it is used for mak

ing pickles, and because of its
high content of pectin is popular as a constituent of jams

, jellies, and other
gelled preserves. It has established itself in the wild in Baja Calif

ornia.



It is not known when the plant was first cultivated, but Zohary and Hopf note
ev

idence of its cultivation in the Nile Valley from at least as early as the
second millenni

um BC. Finds of the characteristically large seed are reported in
Twelfth dynasty sites/ n

umerous watermelon seeds were recovered from the tomb of
Pharaoh Tutankhamun./ref/Daniel Z

ohary and Maria Hopf, Domestication of Plants
in the Old World, third edition /Oxford/ Uni

versity Press, 2000/, p. 193.//ref/

By the 10th century AD, watermelons were being cultiv

ated in China, which is
today the world/s single largest watermelon producer. By the 13th 

century,
Moorish invaders had introduced the fruit to Europe/ and, according to John
Maria

ni/s The Dictionary of American Food and Drink, /watermelon/ made its first
appearance in 

an English dictionary in 1615.

Museums Online South Africa list watermelons as having bee

n introduced to North
American Indians in the 1500s. Early French explorers found Native A

mericans
cultivating the fruit in the Mississippi Valley. Many sources list the
watermelon

 as being introduced in Massachusetts as early as 1629. Southern food
historian John Egert

on has said he believes African slaves helped introduce the
watermelon to the United State

s. Texas Agricultural Extension horticulturalist
Jerry Parsons, Ph.D., lists African slave

s and European colonists as having
distributed watermelons to many areas of the world. Par

sons also mentions the
crop being farmed by Native Americans in Florida /by 1664/ and the 

Colorado
River area /by 1799/. Other early watermelon sightings include the Midwestern
sta

tes /1673/, Connecticut /1747/, and the Illiana region /1822/.


Until the 1940s, however,

 it was hard to find watermelons in good condition at
grocery stores. Melon lovers had to 

grow their own, which tended not to keep for
long, purchase them from local grocers suppli

ed by truck farmers, or purchase
them from roadside produce stands. Now they can be found 

in most any local
grocery store, and if preferred in slices or whole, with seeds or withou

t.

Then Charles Fredric Andrus, a horticulturist at the USDA Vegetable Breeding
Laborator

y in Charleston, South Carolina, set out to produce a disease/resistant
and wilt/resistant

 watermelon. The result was /that gray melon from Charleston./
Its oblong shape and hard r

ind made it easy to stack and ship. Its adaptability
meant it could be grown over a wide g

eographical area. It produced high yields
and was resistant to the most serious watermelon

 diseases/ anthracnose and
fusarium wilt. Today, farmers in approximately 44 states in the

 U.S. grow
watermelon commercially, and almost all these varieties have some Charleston
Gr

ay in their lineage. Georgia, Florida, Texas, California and Arizona are the
USA/s largest

 watermelon producers.

This now/common watermelon is large enough that groceries often se

ll half or
quarter melons. There are also some smaller, spherical varieties of watermelon,


both red/ and yellow/fleshed, som

The  Mino/>oans  were a civiliza<tion in Crete in/>n the Aegean Sea. Ceramic items
cre<ted during the Neoli/>ithic period in Crete date to 7000 BC <nd the/>e height of
the Minoa< /> culture flourished fro< approximately 2700 to 1450 BC when the/>ir
<culture/>e was super<eded by the Mycenaean culture. The Mi/>inoans <ere one of the
c/>civilizations that flourished in<and arou/>nd the Mediterranean during< the Bronze
Age of Greec/>e. These civilizations had< much contact with ea/>ach other, sometimes
m<aking it difficult to jud/>ge the extent to< which the Minoans influe/>ence<, or we/>re
influenced by, their neighbors.< Based on depictio/>ns in <inoan art, Minoan
c/>u<ture is often charact/>terized as a matrilineal soc<iety centered on />goddess
worship.

Minoan Pa<aces, such as the on/>ne at Knossos<, were te/>chnologically <advanced/> 
e<panded drainage systems, aqueducts, /> and deep<wells that provided fresh water/>r
to the inhabitants. The palaces were<multi storied and contained interior /> and
exterior <taircases, light wells, massiv/>e columns, storage magazines, a<d
courtyards.

The term  Minoan  wa/>as coined by the Bri<ish archaeologist Sir Ar/>rthur Evans<after
the mythic  king  Mi/>nos associated with the labyrinth, w<hich Ev/>vans identified as
the site at Knosso<s. It is not kn/>own wh<ether  Mino/>s  was< a personal name or a
title. W/>hat< the Minoans called themselves />is unknown, although the E<gyptian
place name  Keftiu    kaf/>ft<  />w  and the S<mitic  Kaftor  or  Caphtor />  and
 Kaptar<a  in the Mari archives apparently refer/>s to the isl<and of Crete.

Much/> later, the Odysse<y calls the non Greek speaking native/>s of <Crete
Eteocretans meaning, /> true Cretans .

Chronology and histo<y



/>R<ather than give calendar dates for th/>he Minoan period, archaeologist<s use two
systems of relative c/>hronology. The first<, created by Eva/>ans and modified by
later a<rchaeologists, is ba/>ased on pottery styles. It divides the <inoan period
into three main eras /> mdash Early Minoan  EM , Mid<le M/>Minoan  MM , and La<e
Minoan  LM . These /> eras are further subdivided, e.g. Ea<rly Mi/>inoan I, II< III
 EM/>MI< EMII, EMIII . Anoth/>her dating system, proposed by the< Greek archaeologist/>
Nicolas Pl<ton, is based on the development of th/>h< architectural c/>omplexes known
as  palaces  at K<nossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Kato Zakr/>ros, and div<de/>s t<e
Minoan period into Prepalat/>tial, Protopalatial, Neopalati<l, and Post /> palatial
periods. The relationship amon<g these syste/>ms is given in the accompanying
table, <wi/>ith approximate calendar d<ates/> drawn from Warren and H<ankey  1989 .

All calendar dates g/>iven in this article are appro<ximate, and the subject of
on/>going debate.

<The Thera eruption occurred during /> a mature phase of the LM IA period. The<calendar date of the volcanic eruption i/>is extremely <ontroversial  see the
article on The/>ra<eruption for discussion. It often i/>is identified a<s a
catastrophic natural event for th/>he culture, <eadin/>ng to its rapid collapse,
perhap< being rel/>lated mythi<ally as Atlantis /> by Classi<al Greeks.

The beginni<ng of its Bronze Age, around 2600 BC/>C, was a period of great unr<st in
Crete, and also marks the begi/>inning of Cret<e as an important cen/>ter of
civilization.

At the end of <he MMII/>I period  1700 BC < there was a large disturba/>nce in Crete,
probably <an earthquake, or possibly an in/>va<ion from Anatolia. The Pal/>laces at
Knossos, Ph<aistos, Malia, and Kato/> Zakros wer<e destroyed. But with t/>he start of
the Neopalatial period, <opulation increased a/>again, the palaces we<re rebuilt on

 the <seventee/>enth a<d sixteenth centuries BC, MM III / Ne/>opala<tial  represents
/>the apex of t<he Minoan civilization. The Th/>hera e<uption occurred duri/>ing LMIA
 and LHI .

<n the Greek /> mainland, LHIIB began during< LMIB/>B, showing independenc<e from Minoa/>n
influence. At the end of the<LMIB period, the Minoan palac/>ce culture failed
c<atastrophically. All palaces were d/>destroyed, and only Knossos <as immediately
restored   a/>although other palac<s sprang up later in LMIIIA  l/>ike Chania .

LMIB ware has bee<n found in />Egypt under the reigns of Hats<hepsut and Tuthmosis
III. Eit/>her the LMIB/LMII catastrophe occurred<after this time, or else it was
so ba/>ad that the Egyptians then had to impor<t LHIIB instea/>d.
