P>
<P><FONT face=3D"Courier New" color=3Dblack size=3D2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sit up straight!&quot;&nbsp;&#150; There, does=
 that call up old memories of slouching in a chair when you were a kid and a=
n adult telling you that?&nbsp; I know it does for me.&nbsp; I was thinking =
about that just the other day, after I had spent what felt like hours on the=
 computer.&nbsp; I decided to take a break, because my muscles felt tense an=
d my neck was stiff.&nbsp; That's when I realized that I had been sitting al=
l hunched in, with my head jutting forward.&nbsp; And I heard that voice fro=
m childhood saying, &quot;sit up straight!&quot;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's just too bad that, once we are adults, we us=
ually don't have someone reminding us to &quot;sit up straight,&quot; becaus=
e good posture is so important.&nbsp; Memo, you've probably heard that old s=
aying that correct posture can instantly make you look ten pounds lighter.&n=
bsp; Well, it's true!&nbsp; And when you are sitting or standing straight yo=
ur body language conveys confidence and a sense of self-esteem to others.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But your posture also affects your health, as wel=
l.&nbsp; Poor posture can actually create fatigue, because it causes muscles=
, ligaments and joints to work harder.&nbsp; Not to mention the strain on bo=
nes, joints and organs because of unnecessary pressure.&nbsp; For example, I=
've read that looking down at a 45-degree angle instead of holding your head=
 upright uses five times more energy.&nbsp; And the strain on your muscles d=
ecreases the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain by as much as 30 percent.=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good way to check out your posture is to stand =
with your back to a wall.&nbsp; If your shoulders, bottom, and back of your =
head are touching the wall, your posture is correct.&nbsp; If they're not, m=
ove around so that they are, and check how that feels.&nbsp; Another quick w=
ay is to take a big deep breath in, being sure to expand and lift your chest=
 up.&nbsp; When you do this, your head automatically will straighten up and =
move back, your shoulders will move down and back, giving you the correct po=
sture.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Memo, the next time you are feeling muscle fa=
tigue or strain, take a deep breath and &quot;sit up straight&quot;!
