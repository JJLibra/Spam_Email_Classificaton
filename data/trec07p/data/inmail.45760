Dear valued member.
We are sure that your health isn’t the least thing you care of – so, please, read the valuable piece of advice our Association offers you.
Not all the meds offered in numerous Web pharmacies are as qualitative as you might wish them to be. According to the results of the official research made by our Association only one (USDrugs) out of 46 online drugstores analyzed offers drugs of true generic quality.
Hope that this letter would be useful for you, your friends and relatives.
