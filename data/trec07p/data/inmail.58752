Attn Sir/Madam,

I am Robins Jakeman a solicitor and legal practitioner
based in United Kingdom. I am the personal attorney to
Dr. George Brumley who was a consultant with Shell UK
LTD here in London, who shall be referred to as my
client. On the 21st of July 2003, my client Dr. George
Brumley and his family were involved in a fatal plane
crash in Nairobi Kenya, East Africa.
Unfortunately my client Mr. George and his family lost
their lives.

Here is the website of the incident that struck on
that faithful day.
http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.html

Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any
of my clients extended relatives and this has proved
unsuccessful.
After several unsuccessful attempts to locate any
member of his family hence I contacted you. I am
contacting you to assist in repatriating the money
left behind by my client before they get confiscated
or declared unclaimed by the
Financial Institution where this huge deposit were
lodged. Particularly, the finance company where the
deceased had the said fund valued at USD20 million
dollars has issued me a notice to provide the next of
kin.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the
relatives for over 3 years, I seek your consent to
present you as the next of kin to the deceased so that
the proceeds of this account valued at $20 Million
Dollars can be paid to your account abroad, you will
have 30% of the money for your role while I will have
60% and 10% for expenses that we
may incur in the cause of processing the claim.

I have access to all necessary legal documents that
can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I
require is your honest co-operation to enable us
seeing this deal through.

I guarantee that this will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of the law. Please kindly get back to me
through my  Prviate email rob_jakman@yahoo.com.hk address or personal phone number for
confidentiality
and send to me your telephone and fax numbers to
enable us discuss further
about this transaction.

Yours sincerely,

Robins Jakeman (Esq.)
