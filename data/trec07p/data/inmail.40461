  Passeriformes familia   Fringillidae genus   [[Crossbill Loxia]] species    L.
  curvirostra  binomial   Loxia curvirostra binomial_authority   Linnaeus, 1758
   The  Common Crossbill    Loxia curvirostra   is a small passerine bird in the
finch family Fringillidae. It breeds in the spruce forests of North America,
where it is known as  Red Crossbill , as well as Europe and Asia  some
populations  different species?  breed in pine forests in certain areas of all
three continents, and in North America, also in Spielas fir. It nests in
conifers, laying 3 ndash 5 eggs.

This crossbill is mainly resident, but will regularly erupt south if its food
source fails. This species will form flocks outside the breeding season, often
mixed with other crossbills.

The crossbills are characterised by the mandibles crossing at their tips, which
gives the group its English name. They are specialist feeders on conifer cones,
particularly the various spruce species but also some populations  different
species?  in Spielas fir and various pine species, and the unusual bill shape is
an adaptation to assist the extraction of the seeds from the cone.

Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour, and females green or yellow, but
there is much variation.

This species is difficult to separate from Parrot Crossbill and Scottish
Crossbill, both of which breed within its Eurasian range. The identification
problem is less severe in North America, where only Red Crossbill and White 
winged Crossbill occur.

Plumage distinctions from Parrot and Scottish Crossbills are negligible. The
head and bill are smaller than in either of the other species. Care is needed to
identify this species. The glip or chup call is probably the best indicator.

Work on vocalisation in North America suggest that, in that continent alone,
there are eight or nine populations of Red Crossbill with different calls, which
rarely if ever interbreed. These forms also vary in terms of bill size and
structure, and specialise on the seed cones of different species of conifer. Few
ornithologists seem inclined to give these forms species status at present.

Some large billed, pine feeding populations currently assigned to this species
in the Mediterranean area may possibly be better referred to either Parrot
Crossbill or alternatively to new species in their own right, but as yet,
research into them is still at a very early stage. These include Balearic
Crossbill L. curvirostra balearica and North African Crossbill L. curvirostra
poliogyna, feeding primarily on Aleppo Pine  Pinus halepensis   Cyprus Crossbill
L. curvirostra guillemardi, feeding primarily on European black pine  Pinus
nigra   and an as yet unidentified crossbill with a Parrot Crossbill size bill
feeding primarily on Bosnian Pine  Pinus heldreichii  in the Balkans. These
populations also differ on plumage, with the Balearic, North African and Cyprus
races having yellower males, and the Balkan type having deep purple pink males 
this however merely reflects the differing anthocyanin content of the cones they
feed on, as these pigments are transferred to the feathers.

The /Northern Fli

cker/ /Colaptes auratus/ is a medium/sized member of the
woodpecker family. It is native t

o most of North America, parts of Central
America, is one of the few woodpecker species th

at migrates, and is the only
woodpecker that commonly feeds on the ground.

Appearance

Ad

ults are brown with black bars on the back and wings and measure approximately
32 cm /12.5

 inches/ in length. A necklace/like black patch occupies the upper
breast, while the lower

 breast and belly are beige with black spots. Males can
be identified by a black or red mo

ustachial stripe at the base of the beak. The
tail is dark on top, transitioning to a whit

e rump which is conspicuous in
flight.

There are two forms which were formerly considered

 separate species/

/ The /Yellow/shafted Flicker/ resides in eastern North America. They 

are yellow
  under the tail and underwings and have yellow shafts on their primudles. They


  have a grey cap, a beige face and a red bar at the nape of their neck. Males
  have a b

lack moustache.
/ The /Red/shafted Flicker/ resides in western North America. They are red

 under
  the tail and underwings and have red shafts on their primudles. They have a
  bei

ge cap and a grey face. Males have a red moustache.

These two forms interbreed where thei

r ranges overlap.

Behavior Breeding ]] Their breeding habitat is forested areas across No

rth
America, as far south as Central America. They nest in a cavity in a tree or
post/ thi

s bird excavates its own home. Abandoned flicker nests create habitat
for other cavity nes

ters. They are sometimes driven from nesting sites by
European Starlings.

It takes about 

1 to 2 weeks to build the nest which is built by both sexes of
the mating pairs. Damaged n

ests or previously abandoned cavities may be
repaired. The entrance hole is roughly 5 cm t

o 10 cm wide. Flickers will
sometimes be willing to use a birdhouse if it is adequately si

zed and properly
situated.

Typically 6 to 8 eggs are laid, having a shell that is pure wh

ite with a smooth
surface and high gloss. The eggs are the second largest of the North Ame

rican
woodpecker species, exceeded only by the Pileated Woodpecker/s. Incubation is by
bot

h sexes for approximately 11 to 12 days. The young are fed by regurgitation
and leave the 

nest about 25 to 28 days after hatching.

Northern birds migrate to the southern parts of 

the range/ southern birds are
often permanent residents.

Diet According to the Audubon gu

ide, /flickers are the only woodpeckers that
frequently feed on the ground/, probing with 

their bill, also sometimes catching
insects in flight. Although they eat fruits, berries, 

seeds and nuts, their
primary food is insects. Ants alone can make up 45/ of their diet. T

hey have a
behavior called anting, during which they use the acid from the ants to assist


in preening, as it is useful in keeping them free of parasites.

Call and flight This bird

/s call is a sustained laugh, ki ki ki ki ..., more
congenial than that of the Pileated Wo

odpecker. You could also hear a constant
knocking as they often drum on trees or even meta

l objects to declare territory.

Like many woodpeckers, its flight is undulating. The repe

ated cycle of a quick
succession of flaps followed by a pause creates an effect comparable

 to a
rollercoaster.

Scientific and other names

The scientific name of the Yellow/shafte

d Flicker, Colaptes auratus, literally
means /yellow pecker/. Colaptes comes from the Gree

k verb colapt, to peck.
Auratus is from the Latin root aurat, meaning /gold/ or /golden/ a

nd refers to
the bird/s underwing. The scientific name of the Red Shafted Flicker, Colapte

s
auratus cafer, is the result of an error made in 1788 by the German systematist,
Johann 

Gmelin, who believed that its original habitat was in South Africa among
the Kaffir people

.

There are over 100 common names for the Northern Flicker. Among them are/ Clape,
gaffer

 woodpecker, harry/wicket, heigh/ho, wake/up, walk/up, wick/up, yarrup,
and gawker bird. M

any of these names are attempts at imitating some of its
calls. /br style//clear/both////



Alabama Yellowhammers Under its local name /Yellowhammer/, the Yellow/shafted
Flicker is 

the state bird of Alabama./ref///ref/

Alabama has been known as the /Yellowhammer State/ 

since the American Civil War.
The yellowhammer nickname was applied to the Confederate sol

diers from Alabama
when a company of young cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, under the com

mand of
Rev. D.C. Kelly, arrived at Hopkinsville, KY, where Gen. Forrest/s troops were
sta

tioned. The officers and men of the Huntsville company wore fine, new
uniforms, whereas th

e soldiers who had long been on the battlefields were
dressed in faded, worn uniforms. On

gives the group its English <ame. They are specialist feeders on coni/>ifer cones,
partic<ularly the /> various<spruce species but al/>lso some population<  dif/>ffer<ent
species?  in Spielas fir and var/>ious pine spec<es, and the unusual /> bill shape is
an ad<aptation to assi/>ist the extraction of< the seeds from the co/>one.

Adult males tend to be red or <range />in colour, and f<em/>ales g<een or yellow, but
there is much /> variation.

This species is<difficult t/>o separate from Parro< Cros/>ssbill and Scottish
Crossb<ll,/> both o<f which breed within /> its Eurasian range. The i<entification
problem is less seve/>ere in North America, where only Red C<rossbill and White 
winged Crossb/>ill occur.

Plumage distinctions fro< Parrot and Scottish Crossbills are n/>negligible. The
head and bill are smal<er than in either of the /> other spec<ies. Care is needed/> to
identify <his species. The glip or/>r chup call is probably <he best in/>ndicator.

Work on vocalisation in <orth America suggest that/>t, in that<continent alone/>,
there are eight or nine populatio<s of Re/>ed Crossbill with differen< calls, which
rarely if ever in/>terbreed. These forms< also />vary in terms o< bill size and
structu/>re, and specialise on the seed<cones of/>f different sp<cies /> of conifer. Few
orn<ith/>ologists seem inclined <to give these forms species status/> at present.

Some large billed, <ine feeding populations currently /> assigned to this species
in th< Mediterranean area may possib/>ly be bette< />referred to either Parr<ot
Crossbill />or alternative<y /> t< new species in their own right/>t, but as yet,
r<esearc/>h in<to them is still at a very ea/>rly stage. These include Balearic
Crossb<ill L. curvirostra bale/>arica and North African Crossbill L. cur<virostra
poliogyna, feeding pri/>marily on Aleppo P<ine  Pinus halepensis   Cypr/>us Crossbill
L. curvirostra <guillemar/>di, feeding primari<y on European black pine  Pinus
n/>nigra  <and/>d an as< yet unidentified cr/>rossbill with a Parrot Cross<ill size bill
feedin/>ng primarily on Bosnian <ine  Pinus heldreichii  in the Bal/>kans. These
populatio<ns also differ/> on plumage, with the Balearic,< North African and Cyprus
races having/> yellower males, and t<he Balkan type ha/>avi<g deep pur/>rple p<nk /> males 
this <owever merely reflects/>s the differing anthocyanin cont<ent of the con/>es<they
feed on,/>, as these pigments a<re transfe/>rred to the feathers.
