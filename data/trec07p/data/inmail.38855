" Mia! I know you must be expecting a gift from me on our wedding night. I hate to disappoint you but the fact is that I couldnt buy you a gift. Not because I didnt have enough money or that I couldnt remember but because I couldnt find something as gorgeous as you are. Everything looked dull compared to you. So I thought I better ask you. Ill get you whatever you want."
