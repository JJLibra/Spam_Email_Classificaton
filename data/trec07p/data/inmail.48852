I am the above named person Sis Marryat Dhillon from Indian. I am married to
  Dr.Frederick Mark Dhillon, who worked with indian finacial of comernce in cote d'ivoire for nine years before he died in the year 2003.We were married for fourteen years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only five days. 
 
Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $3.8Million (Three Million eight hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one security company in Abidjan the country of cote d'ivoire. 
 Presently, this money was packaged in a truck box and my late husband was deposited it as a family valuebles for security seasons which he choose me as the next of kin,
   
   I am in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer. 
 I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I might not be able to Survive this illness from all indications. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to victims of HIV/aids, charities donations, Orphans and other needy persons in your country. Because Relatives and friends have plundered so much of my husband wealth since my Illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them anymore. 
  
I want a person that is God fearing someone that will use this money to assist me and utilize it for orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that Giveth, I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not believers and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. 
  
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not be able to use the telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.
   
  My Doctor will explained further to you the contact of the  security company where my late husband deposited the trunk box that contains the money under the agreement of me been the next of kin of the money to enable you open your comminucations with the security company director for retrieveing the box for the God's project. 
   
   l do not want unGodly Man to handle this Transaction. also, l will rend you all the related documents needed when proceeding. that was one of the major reason why l contacted you, Note that the officials of the security company did not know that the truck box was contains money in case if you want get in touch with them. 
   
  Looking to hear from you as soon as possible,
