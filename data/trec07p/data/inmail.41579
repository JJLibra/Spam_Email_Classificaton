  Distribution the Green winged Teal in North America and the Common Teal in
  Europe and Asia
  

The  Green winged Teal   GWT, Anas carolinensis  is a common and widespread duck
which breeds in the northern areas of North America except on the Aleutian
Islands. It was considered conspecific with the Common Teal for some time, and
the issue is still being reviewed by the American Ornithologists  Union
[http //www.museum.lsu.edu/ Remsen/SACCBaseline.html]  based on this the IUCN
and BirdLife International  BirdLife International, 2004  do not accept it as a
separate species at present. However, nearly all other authorities consider it
distinct nowadays, based on behavioral  Laurie Ahlberg   McKinney 1979 ,
morphological  Livezey, 1991 , and molecular  Johnson   Sorenson 1999  evidence
 discussed by Sangster et al., 2002 .

This dabbling duck is strongly migratory and winters far south of its breeding
range. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and will form
large flocks. In flight, the fast, twisting flocks resemble waders.

This is the smallest North American dabbling duck. The breeding male has grey
flanks and back, with a yellow rear end and a white edged green speculum,
obvious in flight or at rest. It has a chestnut head with a green eye patch. It
is distinguished from drake Common Teal  the Eurasian relative of this bird  by
a vertical white stripe on side of breast, the lack of both a horizontal white
scapular stripe and the lack of thin buff lines on its head.

The females are light brown, with plumage much like a female Mallard. They can
be distinguished from most ducks on size and shape, and the speculum. Separation
from female Common Teal is problematic.

In non breeding  eclipse  plumage, the drake looks more like the female.

It is a common duck of sheltered wetlands, such as taiga bogs, and usually feeds
by dabbling for plant food or grazing. It nests on the ground, near water and
under cover. While its conservation status is not evaluated by IUCN at present
due to non recognition of the taxon, it is plentiful enough to make it a species
of Least Concern if it were  it is far more plentiful than the Common Teal
 Carboneras, 1992 . It can be seen in vast numbers in the Marismas Nacionales of
western Mexico, a main wintering area.

This is a noisy species. The male has a clear whistle, whereas the female has a
feeble  quack .

Relationships mtDNA data wise, this species is more closely related to the
Speckled Teal than to the Common Teal  Johnson   Sorenson 1999 . This would
require that sexual dimorphism either was lost in the Speckled Teal or that it
evolved in near identical forms in the Green winged and Common Teal after the
divergence of the Green winged and Speckled Teal lineages.

Both hypotheses seem rather spurious initially, with the GWT and Common Teal s
male nuptial plumage being unique and very complex, and the tendency to gain,
not lose, strong sexual dimorphism overwhelming in the dabbling ducks. An
alternative explanation given the high frequency of hybridisation in ducks
 Carboneras, 1992  would be that the mtDNA of the present day GWT is originally
derived from Spotted Teal females by introgression and thus the molecular data
gives a misleading picture of the species  true relationships. This is supported
by the observation that in Mallard    American Black Duck hybrids, females of
both taxa prefer the sexually dimorphic mallard drakes over the dull plumaged
Black Duck drakes  Brodsky et al., 1988, but see also Rhymer et al., 1994   that
the GWT is in some aspects   such as the less contrasting nuptial plumage  
intermediate between the Common and Speckled Teal is also interesting to note.

Alternatively, the Common Teal might actually be derived from the GWT, with the
molecular difference being due to genetic drift or a founder effect in the
latter and possibly Speckled Teal introgression in the former. The three teals
certainly belong to a superspecies in the teals   Nettion    the ancestors of
this group were most likely sexually monomorphic Southern Hemisphere forms
 Johnson   Sorenson, 1999  note that their  African  distribution includes
Bernier s Teal taxa which like many Madagascar taxa is of Indo Australian
origin .

Still another possibility   and perhaps the most likely one ref  The trans 
Beringia populations are of the Common Teal type, which would be odd if the
lineage is of South American origin /ref   , is that the American lineage is
derived from stray Common Teals, with the founder effect/genetic drift and/or
hybrid introgression phenomena applying as above, only in the reverse direction
for the former two. Still, this would require loss of sexual dimorphism in the
ancestors of the Speckled Teal, but while extremely rare in dabbling ducks, it
is not per se impossible.

The close Speckled GWT relationship suggested by mtDNA data could of course
still apply to the taxa in general, not just to sequences in 2 maternally
inherited genes in a few individual ducks  for which it without doubt does
apply , but the overall failure of Johnson   Sorenson to seriously take
hybridization into account and their small sample sizes and obsolete conceptions
of Indian Ocean biogeography do not help at all to resolve the issue ref  No</STYLE>

/Ungulates/ /meaning roughly /being hoofed/ or /ho

ofed animal// are several
groups of mammals most of which use the tips of their toes, usua

lly hoofed, to
sustain their whole bodyweight whilst moving. They make up several orders o

f
mammals, of which six to eight survive. There is some dispute as to whether
ungulate sho

uld be treated as an actual cladistic /evolution/based/ group, or
merely a phenetic group 

/similar, but not necessarily related/, in light of the
fact that all ungulates do not app

ear to be as closely related as once believed
/see below/. Ungulata was formerly considere

d an order which has been split into
Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla. Members of these two

 orders are called the
/true ungulates/ to distinguish them from /subungulates/ /paenungul

ata/ which
include members from the Proboscidea, Sirenia, and Hyracoidea
orders./ref/Mammo

logy/ adaptation, diversity, and ecology, Feldhammer, George A.
1999, p. 312//ref/

Some c

ommonly known examples of Ungulates living today are the horse, zebra,
donkey, cow, rhinoc

erous, camel, hippopotamus, goat, sheep, giraffe, deer,
antelope, and gazelle.


Relations

hips The Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla make up the largest portion of
ungulates, and als

o comprise the majority of large land mammals. These two
groups first appeared during the 

late Paleocene and early Eocene /about 54
million years ago/, rapidly spreading to a wide 

variety of species on numerous
continents, and have developed in parallel since that time.



Although whales and dolphins /Cetacea/ do not possess most of the typical
morphological 

characteristics of ungulates, recent discoveries have suggested
that they are likely desce

nded from early artiodactyls, and thus are directly
related to other even/toed ungulates s

uch as cattle and hippopotami. As a result
of these discoveries, a new order of Cetartioda

ctyla has also been proposed to
include the members of Artiodactyla and Cetacea, to reflec

t their common
ancestry/ however, strictly speaking, this is not necessary, as it is possi

ble
simply to recognize Cetacea as a subgroup of Artiodactyla.

The Hyracoidea, Sirenia an

d Proboscidea are the Paenungulata. The Tubulidentata
are also thought to be ungulates. Th

e Macroscelidea have been interpreted as
ungulates, and there is dental as well as genetic

 evidence supporting this
interpretation. The Macroscelidea and Tubulidentata have recentl

y been united
with the Paenungulata in the Pseudungulata. Genetic studies indicate that th

ese
animals are not closely related to the artiodactyls and perissodactyls. Instead,
the c

losest relatives of pseudungulates are the Afrosoricida/ the Pseudungulata
and Afrosoricid

a make up the Afrotheria.

Ungulate groups represented in the fossil record include the em

brithopods,
demostylians, mesonychids, /condylarths/ and various South American and
Paleog

ene lineages.

In addition to hooves, most ungulates have developed reduced canine teeth,


bunodont molars /molars with low, rounded cusps/, and an astragalus /one of the
ankle bone

s at the end of the lower leg/ with a short, robust head.

Another characteristic of most 

ungulates is the fusion of the front forelimbs.
In ungulates, the radius and ulna are fuse

d along the length of the forelimb.
This is a trait of most modern ungulates, as early ung

ulates, such as the
arctocyonids did not share this unique skeletal structure/ref/Christin

e M.
Janis, Kathleen M. Scott, and Louis L. Jacobs, Evolution of Tertiary Mammals of
North

 America, Volume 1. /Cambridge/ Cambridge University Press, 1998/, 322/
23.//ref/. The fus

ion of the radius and ulna prevents an ungulate from rotating
its forelimb. Since this ske

letal structure has no specific function in
ungulates, it is considered to be a homologous

 characteristic that ungulates
share with other mammals. This trait would have been passed

 down from a common
ancestor.

Ungulates diversified rapidly in the Eocene, but are though

t to date back as far
as the late Cretaceous. Most ungulates are herbivores, but a few are

 omnivores

Recent d

evelopments That these groups of mammals are most closely related to
each other has occasi

onally been questioned on anatomical and genetic grounds.
Molecular phylogenetic studies h

ave suggested that Perissodactyla and
Cetartiodactyla are closest to Carnivora and Pholido

ta rather than to the
Pseudungulata.

The Pseudungulata are by some scientists united with

 the Afrosoricida in the
cohort or super/order Afrotheria based on molecular and DNA analy

sis. This means
they are not related to other ungulates.

The orders of the extinct South/

American ungulates, which arose when the
continent was in isolation some time during the m

id to late Paleocene, are

The  <Green/> winged T<eal   GWT, Anas carolinensis  is a c/>ommon and widespread duck
which bre<eds in the northern />areas of North Am<erica except on the Aleutian
/>
Island<. It was considered />conspecific with the Common Teal< for some time, and
/>the issue is still bei<ng review/>ed <y the America/>an Ornitholo<gists  Union
[http //www.museum.lsu.edu/>u/ Remsen/S<CCBaseline.html]  based on this the /> IUCN
and BirdLife International<  Bird/>Life International, 2004  do not accept< it as a
separate species at/> present. However, nearly all oth<er authorities c/>consider it
distinct< nowadays, based on behaviora/>l  Laurie Ahlberg   McKinne<y 1979 ,
morphological  Live/>zey, 1991 , and m<olecular  Johnson   Sorenson 1999  evide/>nce
 discuss<ed by Sangster et al., 2002 .
/>
This dabbling <duck is strongly migratory and winters /> far south of its breeding
range. I<t is highly gregarious outside of the/> breeding season and will form
la<rge flocks. In flight, the fast, t/>wisting <locks resemble waders.

This is the/>e smalle<t North Amer/>ican dabbling duck. The breeding male ha<s grey
flanks and back,/>, w<th/> a ye<low /> rear end and a w<ite edged gree/>en speculum,
obvious in flight or at res<. It has a chestnut head with a green e/>eye patch. It
is <istinguished from d/>rake Common Teal  the Eu<rasian relative of th/>his bird  by
a vertical white stripe<on side of breast, the lack of both a />horizontal white
s<capular stripe and the lack of thin buff/> lines on its head.

<The females are light brow/>n, with plumage mu<ch like a fema/>le Mallard. They can
be <distinguished from most duck/>s on size and shape, a<nd/> the specu<lum. Separation
from fem/>male Common Teal is pro<lematic.

In non bre/>edi<g  eclipse  plumage, the drake look/>ks more like the female.

It is a commo< duck of sheltered wetlands, such as/> taiga< bogs, and usually feeds
by da/>bbling for plant food or grazing. I<t nests on the ground, near water /> an<
under cover. While its conserva/>tion status is not evaluated by IUCN a<t/>t present
due to non recognitio<n of the taxon, it is plentifu/>l enough to make it a species
of Le<ast Concer/>n if it were  it is far more pl<e/>ntiful than the Common Teal
 <a/>arboneras, 1992 . It ca<n be seen in vast numbers/>s in the Marismas Nacio<nales of
western Me/>xico, a main wintering are<a.

This is a noisy />speci<es. The male has a clear />whistle, <wherea/>as the <emale has a
feeble  quack .

Relat/>tionships mtDNA data wise, this specie< is more closely related to t/>the
Spe<kled Teal th/>an to the Common Teal  Johnson  < Sorenson 1999 ./> This would
require that sexual dimorph<ism either was lost in the />Speckled Tea< or that it
evol/>lved in near iden<ical forms in the Green winged and/> Common Teal after the
diverge<nce of the Green winged and Spe/>ckl<ed Teal lineages.

Both hypotheses/> seem rath<r spurious init/>ially, with the GWT and Common Teal s
m<ale nuptial plumage b/>eing unique and very comple<x, and the te/>ndency to gain,
<ot lose, st/>trong sexual dimorphism o<erwhelming in th/>e dabbli<ng ducks. An
alterna/>ative explanation<given/>n the <igh frequency of hybridisa/>tion in ducks
 Carbone<ras, 1992 />  would be that the mtDNA of the present<day GWT is origina/>ally
derived from Spotted T<al females/>s by intr<ogression and thus the mol/>ecular data
gives a misleading pict<ure of the species  true relatio/>nships<. This is supported
by the observation/> that in Mallard    Ame<rican Black Duc/>ck hybrids, females of
bot< taxa prefer />the sexually dimorphic m<allard drakes over th/>e dull plumaged
Black <uck />d<akes  Brodsky et al., 19/>988, but see also Rhymer et al.< 1994 />   that
the GWT is in some aspects   su<h as the less contrasting n/>nuptial plumage  
intermediat<e between /> the <ommon an/>nd Speckled Teal is al<o interesting to note.

Alt/>ernatively, the Common Teal might actual<ly be derived/>d from <he GWT, with the
molecular difference/>e being due to genetic drift <r a founder/>r <ffect in the
latter and possib/>ly Speckled Teal introgression in the f<rmer. The three teals
certainly belong /> to a supers<ecies in the teals   Nettion    t/>h<e ancestors of
this group were most />likely sexually monom<rph/>ic South<ern Hemisphere forms
 Johnson   Soren/>son, 1999  no<e that their  African/>n  distribution includes
Bernier <s Teal taxa which l/>ike man<y Madagascar tax/>a is of Indo <ustralian
origi/>in .

Still another pos<sibility   and perhaps t/>he <mo/>ost likely one ref  The tr<ns 
Beringia populations are of the Co/>ommon Teal type, which would be odd if<the
lineage is of South American orig/>in /ref   , is that the Americ<an lineage is
derived from stray Common /> Te<als, with the founder effect/genetic dr/>ift and/or
hybrid introgress<on phenomena applyin/>ng as above, o<nly in the reverse d/>irect<ion
for the fo/>rmer two. Sti<l/>ll, this would <require loss of/> sexual dimorphism in the
ancestors of t<e Speckled Teal, but while extr/>emely rare in da<bbling ducks, it
is/>s< not per se imp/>ossible.

The close Spec<kled GWT relati/>onship suggested by mtDNA data< could of course
still apply to t/>he <taxa in g/>eneral, not jus<t to sequences i/>n 2 maternally<
i/>inherited gen<s in a few individual ducks  for wh/>hich it without <oubt does
app/>ply , but the overall failure of J<ohnson   Sorenson to seriousl/>ly take
hybridization i<nto/> account and their small sample s<zes and obsolete conceptio/>ns
of Indian Ocean biogeo<graphy do not help/>p at all to resolve the issue ref  No/></STYLE><p><HR width="90%" SIZE=1><p><center>
