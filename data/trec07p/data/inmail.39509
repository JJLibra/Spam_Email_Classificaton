<STYLE> For other uses, see [[Ovid  disambiguation ]] ]]  Publius Ovidius Naso 
 Sulmona, March 20, 43 BC     Tomis, now Constan  a AD 17 , a Roman poet known
to the English speaking world as  Ovid , wrote on topics of love, abandoned
women and mythological transformations. Ranked alongside Virgil and Horace as
one of the three ical poets of Latin literature, Ovid was generally considered
the greatest master of the elegiac couplet. His poetry, much imitated during
Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, had a decisive influence on European art and
literature for centuries.

Life and work   ]] Ovid wrote in elegiac couplets, with two exceptions  his lost
[[Medea]], whose two fragments are in iambic trimeter and anapests,
respectively, and his great   Metamorphoses  , which he wrote in dactylic
hexameter, the meter of Virgil s [[Aeneid]] and of Homer s epics. Ovid offers an
epic unlike those of his predecessors, a chronological account of the cosmos
from creation to his own day, incorporating many myths and legends about
supernatural transformations from the Greek and Roman traditions.

Ovid was born March 20 sup th /sup  in Sulmo, which lies in a valley within the
Apennines, east of Rome. He was born into an equestrian ranked family and was
educated at Rome. His father wished for him to study rhetoric with the ultimate
goal of practising law. As stated by Pliny the Elder, Ovid leaned toward the
emotional side of rhetoric as opposed to the argumentative. After the death of
his father, Ovid renounced law and began his travels. He traveled to Athens,
Asia Minor, and Sicily. He also held some minor public posts, but quickly gave
them up to pursue his poetry. He was part of the circle centered around the
patron Messalla. He was married three times and, from these marriages, had one
daughter.

In 10 BC, the Amores were published. Book 1 of this collection of love elegy
contains 15 poems, which look at the different areas of love poetry. Perhaps the
most notable poem of this collection is Poem 6, written in the genre of
paraclausithyron, in which Ovid plays the role of exclusus amator asking the door 
keeper to let him enter the house of his beloved. Much of the Amores is tongue in 
cheek, and while Ovid appears to be taking the normal route of a love poem, he
often uses this as a ploy before going against the norm and to a certain extent
mocking the other love poets who he felt were not as good as himself.

By AD 8, Ovid had completed his most famous work, a compilation of Roman and
Greek mythology called the Metamorphoses. The book discusses the myths of Jason
and the Golden Fleece, Medea, and the many love affairs of Zeus. It is extremely
sexual in nature, and was widely censured upon its publication. However, for
literary scholars today the book is very valuable, as it offers an explanation
to many alluded myths in other works. It is also a valuable source for those
attempting to piece together Roman religion, as many of the characters in the
book are Olympian gods or their offspring.

Augustus banished Ovid in AD 8 to Tomis on the Black Sea for reasons that remain
mysterious, though it is largely speculated that something in the Metamorphoses
offended him. Ovid himself wrote that it was because of carmen et error      a
poem and a mistake   Tr. 2.207 . The error itself is uncertain, but it is
believed that Ovid may have had an affair with a female relative of Augustus, or
withheld knowledge of such an affair. As Julia the Younger  the granddaughter of
Augustus , and Ovid were exiled in the same year, some suspect that he was
somehow involved in her affair with Decimus Silanus  ref Alan H.F. Griffin,
Ovid s  Metamorphoses , Greece   Rome, 2nd Ser., Vol. 24, No. 1.  Apr., 1977 ,
p. 58. /ref . The carmen is probably his [[Metamorphoses]]. While some speculate
that the poem was one of Ovid s love poems which offered amorous advice to both
sexes, this is almost certainly untrue. The Julian Marriage Laws of 18 BC were
still fresh in the minds of Romans  these laws had promoted sexual relations
 though monogamous, maritial ones  in Rome in order to promote population
growth, and spurred a mass of advisory love poems upon their passage.

It was during this period of exile     more properly known as a relegation    
that Ovid wrote two more collections of poems, called [[Tristia]] and
[[Epistulae ex Ponto]], which illustrate his sadness and desolation. Being far
away from Rome, Ovid had no chance to research in libraries and thus was forced
to abandon his work Fasti. Even though he was friendly with the natives of Tomis
and even wrote poems in their language, he still pined for Rome and his beloved
third wife. Many of the poems are addressed to her, but also to Augustus, whom
he calls Caesar and sometimes God, to himself, and even sometimes to the poems
themselves, which expresses his heart felt solitude. The famous first two lines
of the Tristia demonstrate the poet s misery from the start 

 Parve     nec invideo     sine me, liber, ibis in urbem 
  ei mihi, quod domino non licet ire tuo 

 Little book     and I won t hinder you     go on to the city without me 
  Alas for me, because your master is not allowed to go 

Ovid died at Tomis after nearly ten years of banishment. He is commemorated
today by a statue in the Romanian cit</STYLE>

// The /Snow Bunting/, //Plectrophenax n

ivalis//, is a passerine bird in the
bunting family Emberizidae, a group separated by most

 modern authors from the
Fringillidae /Old World finches/. It is the sister species of the

 Beringian
McKay/s Bunting, with which it reputedly hybridizes in Alaska.

This bird is an

 arctic specialist, with a circumpolar arctic breeding range
throughout the northern hemis

phere. There is a small isolated population on the
high mountain tops of Scotland. The bre

eding habitat is treeless moors, tundra
and bare mountains. During the last ice age, the s

pecies was widespread
throughout continental Europe /Tomek / Boche//ski 2005/.

It is migr

atory, wintering in northern temperate areas. In winter, it forms
mobile flocks, usually o

n coasts. It shows little fear of humans.

In flight, its large white wing patches easily 

identify this 15.5/18 cm long
species. The breeding male is unmistakable, with all white p

lumage and a black
back. Other plumages are pale ginger above and white below. The bill is

 yellow
with a black tip /all black in summer males/. Unlike most passerines, it has
feath

ered tarsi, an adaptation to its harsh environment. No other passerine can
winter as far n

orth as this species apart from the Common Raven.

The call is a distinctive rippling whis

tle, /per,r,r,rit/ and the typical
Plectrophenax warble /hudidi feet feet feew hudidi/.

T

he Snow Bunting builds its bulky nest in rock crevices. Blue/green brown/
spotted eggs hat

ch in two weeks, and in another fortnight the young are already
ready to fly.

Cultural re

ferences The Snow Bunting is referred to in the novel [[Kristnihald
undir J//kli]] /Christ

ianity under the Glacier/ by Halld//r Laxness/

/ /Pastor J//n// In school debates the que

stion was sometimes put whether God
/ was not incapable of creating a stone so heavy that 

He couldn/t lift it. Often
/ I think the Almighty is like a snow bunting abandoned in all 

weathers. Such a
/ bird is about the weight of a postage stamp. Yet he does not blow away 

when he
/ stands in the open in a tempest. Have you ever seen the skull of a snow
/ buntin

g? He wields this fragile head against the gale, with his beak to the
/ ground, wings fold

ed close to his sides and his tail pointing upwards/ and the
/ wind can get no hold on him

, and cleaves. Even in the fiercest squalls the
/ bird does not budge. He is becalmed. Not

 a single feather stirs. /Embi// How
/ do you know that the bird is the Almighty, and not 

the wind? /Pastor J//n//
/ Because the winter storm is the most powerful force in Iceland,

 and the snow
/ bunting is the feeblest of all God/s conceptions.

offend<ed him. Ovid himself wrote />that it was because of carme<n et e/>rror      a
poem and a mistake   <r. 2.207 . The error itself is u/>uncertain, but it i<
b/>elieved that Ovid may have had an a<ffair with a female relative of Augu/>stus, or
wit<held kno/>owledge of <uch a/>n affair. As J<ulia /> th<e Younger  the granddaughter of
/>Augustus , <and Ovid were exiled /> in the same< year, s/>some susp<ct that /> he <as
somehow involved in her affair w/>with Decimus Silanus  r<ef Alan H.F. Griffin,
Ovid s  Metamo/>rphoses , Greece   Rome, 2nd S<er., Vol. 24, No. 1.  Apr., 1977 ,
p./> 58. /ref <. The carmen is pr/>obably his [[Metamorphoses]]. While s<ome speculat/>te
that the poem was one of Ov<d s love poems which offered a/>amo<ous advice to both
sexes, this is al/>lmost ce<tainly untrue. The Juli/>ian<Marriage Laws of 18 BC were
still fresh /> in the mi<ds/>s of Romans  <hese laws had promoted sex/>ual rela<tions
 though monoga/>mous, maritial ones  in Rome in or<der to promote population
g/>growt<, and spurred a mass of advisory lo/>ove poems upon their pa<ssage.

It was during this period o/>f exile     more properly<known as a relegation    
that />Ovid wrote two more collections of p<oem/>s, called [[Trist<ia]] />and
[[E<istulae /> ex Ponto]], whi<h illustrate his sadness and desolatio/>on. Being far
away from Rome< Ovid had/>d no chance to rese<rch in librarie/>s and thus was forced
<to abandon hi/>s work Fasti. Even though he was fr<endly with the n/>natives of Tomis
and even wrote poems< in their language, he stil/>l pined for Ro<e and his beloved
third wife. Man/>ny of the poems are addressed to her, b<t also to Augustus, whom
he ca/>alls Caesar and sometimes <od, to himself/>f, and<even sometimes to the poems
th/>emselves, which expresses his heart fe<lt solitude. The famous fir/>st two lines
of the Tristia demonst<rat/>e the poet s misery from the star<t 

 Parve     nec invideo     sine me, /> liber, ibis in urbem 
  ei mihi,<quod domino non l/>icet ire tuo

  Alas< for me, because your master is no/>ot allowed to go
