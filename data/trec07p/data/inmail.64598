   Three closely related North American bird forms   the eastern Myrtle Warbler,
its western counterpart, Audubon s Warbler, and the Central American Goldman s
Warbler   are periodically lumped as the  Yellow rumped Warbler   Dendroica
coronata .

Since 1973, American Ornithological Union has elected to merge these passerine
birds as one species. These two forms were apparently separated by glaciation
during the last ice age, and developed distinguishing physical characteristics.
When it was shown however that they were able to interbreed, they no longer
qualified to be considered as separate species. The reluctance of some North
American birdwatchers to accept A.O.U. s change in speciation may stem from the
changes in their  life lists . Technically, what before may have justifiably
counted for two entries should perhaps now be cut back to one.

The Yellow rumped Warbler breeds from eastern North America west to the Pacific,
and southward from there into parts of Mexico. It is a migratory bird which
travels to Central America and the Caribbean for winters. Among warblers it is
one of the last to leave North America in the fall, and among the first to
return. It is an occasional vagrant to the British Isles and Iceland.

In summers, males of both forms have streaked backs of black on slate blue,
white wing patches, a streaked breast, and conspicuous yellow patches on the
crown, flank, and rump. Audubon s Warbler also sports a yellow throat patch,
while the Myrtle Warbler has a white throat and eye stripe, and a contrasting
black cheek patch. Females of both forms are more dull, with brown streaking
front and back, but still have noticeable yellow rumps. Goldman s Warbler, of
Guatemala, resembles Audubon s but has a white lower border to the yellow throat
and otherwise darker plumage  males replace the slate blue of Audubon s with
black.

These birds are primarily insectivorous, although when bugs are scarce, the
Myrtle Warbler also enjoys eating the wax myrtle berries which gave it its name.
They often flit, flycatcher like, out from their perches in short loops, in
search of insects.

They nest in coniferous and mixed woodlands, and lay 4 5 eggs in a cup shaped
nest.

The Yellow rumped has a trill like song of 4 7 syllables  tyew tyew tyew tyew,tew tew 
tew  and an occasional check or chip call note.
