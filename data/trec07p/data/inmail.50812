Greetings to you,
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe=
 everyone will pass on someday everyone eventually has appointment with dea=
th. My name is Abdul Hakim Zamal a merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirate (=
U.A.E).
=20
I have been diagnosed with lung cancer.  It has defiled all forms of medica=
l treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, accordin=
g to medical experts (I am in a private ward in a private hospital here in =
the United Kingdom). I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I ne=
ver really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am =
very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only fo=
cused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for.
=20
But now I regret all this, as I now know that there is more to life than ju=
st wanting to have or make all the money in the world.  I believe when God =
gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a diffe=
rent way from how I have lived it. I have willed and given most of my prope=
rty and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few=
 close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I ha=
ve decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one =
of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to s=
ome charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my h=
ealth has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.
=20
I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribut=
e the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pak=
istan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust=
 them anymore, as they seem not to be contented with what I have left for t=
hem.  The last of my money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit=
 of $18 Million Dollars that I have with a Security Company abroad. I will =
want you to help me collect/receive this deposit and dispatched it to chari=
ty organizations.
=20
I will like to inform you that for all your time, effort and sincere honest=
y you will be given 10% of the funds, this is from the depth of my heart.
=20
I'll be awaiting your quick response.

Wassallam.Abdul Hakim Zamal.
