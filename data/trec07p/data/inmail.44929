 York  is a city in North Yorkshire, England, at the confluence of the rivers
Ouse and Foss. The York urban area has a population of 137,505 whilst the entire
unitary authority  see below  has a population of 184,900.

York is the traditional county town of Yorkshire, to which it lends its name.
However, it did not form part of any of the three historic divisions of
Yorkshire  known as ridings  East Riding, North Riding and West Riding .

Traditionally the term City of York was reserved for the area within the city
walls  a small area outside of the walls, the Ainsty, was often associated with
the City, resulting in the term the City and Ainsty of York , but the modern
 City of York , created on April 1, 1996, is much larger. It is a unitary
authority, and apart from York itself, includes several neighbouring parishes
which formerly belonged to the surrounding districts of Harrogate, Ryedale and
Selby. It borders on the non metropolitan counties of North Yorkshire and the
East Riding of Yorkshire though for ceremonial purposes is part of North
Yorkshire.

The city is the seat of the Archbishop of York, metropolitan bishop of the
Province of York.

York is home to the University of York, founded in 1963, and York St John
University, which was founded in 1841 and gained university status in 2006.

History




The name  York  has an interesting etymological history, ultimately deriving
from the Latin name for the city,  Eboracum , which derived from the Brythonic
ebor acon meaning  place of yew trees . The name may have been derived from
another Roman city in the Iberian peninsula called Ebora  current day Evora in
Portugal . The city was founded in AD 71, and has a rich Roman and Viking
history, acting as capital of the Roman province of Britannia Inferior. After
being settled by the Anglo Saxons, the city was given the name  Eoforwic 
 Meaning  Boar s Dwelling  . It was also one of the capitols of Northumbria, the
other being Bamburgh. It later became the seat of the Archbishop of York, whose
province of York covers northern England, and acted as the centre for the Viking
kingdom of Jorvik. The city remained one of England s main cities throughout the
middle ages, declining in relative importance only with the Industrial
Revolution. York was the capital city of the country before London and is still
a highly vibrant and thriving community to this day.

York s economic downturn during the Industrial Revolution meant that many
medieval structures, elsewhere swept aside to make way for mills and factories,
survived reasonably intact. The renewed interest in medievalism in the 19th
century led to a widespread programme of renovation, and to this day the city
attracts a great deal of tourism, the jewel in the crown being the city s
historic cathedral church, York Minster.



Geography

York lies within the Vale of York, a flat area of arable land bordered by the
Pennines, North York Moors and Wolds. The ings are flood meadows along the River
Ouse, while the [[Strays of York strays]] are scattered around the city in
marshy, low lying places.

During Roman times, the land surrounding the rivers Ouse and Foss was very
marshy, making it easier to defend. The city is prone to severe flooding from
the River Ouse, and has an extensive  but not always effective  network of flood
defences. These include walls along the Ouse, and a barrier across the River
Foss where it joins the Ouse.

The floods of late October and early November 2000, which were the highest for
over 350 years, caused much damage, but the water did not breach the  sandbag
reinforced  flood walls. Much land within the city has always been too flood 
prone for development.

York railway station is situated on the East Coast, Cross Country and
TransPennine mainlines.

Demographics The population of York is about 181,000 [http //www.york 
tourism.co.uk/information/facts.asp].

York s economy is based largely on tourism, science and service based
industries. This is very different from the position as recently as the 1950s,
when York s prosperity was based on chocolate manufacturing and the railways.
Most of the industry around the railway has gone, including the carriage w</STYLE>

// /William Blake/ /November 28 1757 /// August 12 1827/ was an

 English poet,
visionary, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognized during his lifetim

e,
Blake/s work is today considered seminal and significant in the history of both
poetry 

and the visual arts. He was voted 38th in a poll of the 100 Greatest
Britons organized by 

the BBC in 2002.

According to Northrop Frye, who undertook a study of Blake/s entire poet

ic
corpus, his prophetic poems form /what is in proportion to its merits the least
read bo

dy of poetry in the English language./ Others have praised Blake/s visual
artistry, at lea

st one modern critic proclaiming Blake /far and away the
greatest artist Britain has ever 

produced.//ref///ref/ Once considered mad for
his idiosyncratic views, Blake is highly reg

arded today for his expressiveness
and creativity, and the philosophical vision that under

lies his work. As he
himself once indicated, /The imagination is not a State/ it is the Hu

man
existence itself./

While his visual art and written poetry are usually considered sep

arately, Blake
often employed them in concert to create a product that at once defied and


superseded convention. Though he believed himself able to converse aloud with
Old Testamen

t prophets, and despite his work in illustrating the Book of Job,
Blake/s affection for th

e Bible was accompanied by hostility for the established
Church, his beliefs modified by a

 fascination with Mysticism and the unfolding
of the Romantic Movement around him./ref///r

ef/ Ultimately, the difficulty of
placing William Blake in any one chronological stage of 

art history is perhaps
the distinction that best defines him.

Early life William Blake wa

s born in 28A Broad Street, Golden Square, London,
England on 28 November 1757, to a middl

e/class family. He was the third of seven
children, who consisted of one girl and six boys

, two of whom died in infancy.
Blake/s father, James, was a hosier. He never attended scho

ol, being educated at
home by his mother./Ref name//Raine////ref/ The Blakes were Dissente

rs, and are
believed to have belonged to the Moravian church. The Bible was an early and
p

rofound influence on Blake, and would remain a source of inspiration throughout
his life.



Blake began engraving copies of drawings of Greek antiquities purchased for him
by his fa

ther /a further indication of the support his parents lent their son/,
a practice that was

 then preferred to actual drawing. Within these drawings
Blake found his first exposure to

 classical forms, through the work of Raphael,
Michelangelo, Marten Heemskerk and Albrecht

 D//rer. His parents knew enough of
his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to sch

ool but was instead
enrolled in drawing classes. He read avidly on subjects of his own cho

osing.
During this period, Blake was also making explorations into poetry/ his early
work 

displays knowledge of Ben Jonson and Edmund Spenser.

Apprenticeship to Basire On 4 August

 1772, Blake became apprenticed to engraver
James Basire of Great Queen Street, for the te

rm of seven years. At the end of
this period, at the age of 21, he was to become a profess

ional engraver.

There is no record of any serious disagreement or conflict between the tw

o
during the period of Blake/s apprenticeship. However, Peter Ackroyd/s biography
notes th

at Blake was later to add Basire/s name to a list of artistic
adversaries/mdash/and then c

ross it out./ref/43, Blake, Peter Ackroyd, Sinclair/
Stevenson, 1995//ref/ This aside, Bas

ire/s style of engraving was unfortunately
of a kind held to be old/fashioned at the time,

 and Blake/s instruction in this
outmoded form may have had a detrimental effect on his st

ruggles to acquire work
or even recognition in later life.

After two years Basire sent hi

m to copy images from the Gothic churches in
London /it is possible that this task was set

 in order to break up a quarrel
between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice/, an

d his experiences in
Westminster Abbey contributed to the formation of his artistic style 

and ideas/
the Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral
effigi

es and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that /the most immediate
[impression] would ha

ve been of faded brightness and colour/./ref/44, Blake,
Ackroyd//ref/ In the long afternoo

ns Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was
occasionally interrupted by the boys of West

minster School, one of whom
/tormented/ Blake so much one afternoon that he knocked the bo

y off a scaffold
to the ground, /upon which he fell with terrific Violence/. Blake beheld 

more
visions in the Abbey, of a great procession of monks and priests, while he heard
/the

 chant of plain/song and chorale/.

 stooped in prayer, contemplating the world he has for

ged. The [[Song of Los]]

H<istory




The name  York  has a/>n interesting et<ymological histo/>ry,< ultimately deriving
from the Lati/>n name< for the city,  Ebo/>oracum , which derived from the Bryt<onic
ebor acon meaning  plac/>ce of ye<w t/>trees . The name may have been derived <rom
another Roman city in the Ib/>berian peninsula called Ebora  cu<rr/>ent day Evora in
Portugal . The city< was founded in AD 71, and has />a rich Roman and Viking
history, acti<g as capital of th/>he Roman provin<e of Britannia Inferior. Af/>fter
being sett<led by the Anglo Saxons, the city was gi/>iven the name  Eoforwic<
 Meaning  Bo/>oar s Dwel<ling  . It was also one of />the capitols of Northumbria, <t/>the
other being Bamburgh. It later bec<ame the seat of the Archbish/>op of York, whose
pro<vince of York/>k covers northern England, a<nd acted as the centr/>e for the Viking
kingdom of Jorvik<. The city remained o/>n< of England s main citie/>es thro<ghout the
middle /> ages, declining<in relative importance on/>nly with the<Indust/>rial
Revolution< York wa/>s the capital city of the country b<efore London and is />still
a highly vibrant and< thrivin/>g community to this <day.

York s economic do/>ownturn duri<g the Industrial Rev/>volution meant that <any
medieva/>al s<ructures, elsewhere swept aside to ma/>ak< way for mills and fac/>ctories,
survived reasonably intact. Th<e renewed i/>interest in medievalism in t<e 19th
century led/>d to<a widespread progra/>amme <f renovation, and to this day the cit/>ty
attr<cts a great/> de<l of tourism, the jewel /> in the crown being t<e city s
h/>istoric cathedral church, York Minst<er.



Geography

York l/>lies within<the Vale o/>of York, a flat area of<arab/>le land bordered by the
Pennines, <orth York Moors and Wo/>olds. The in<gs are flood />meadows along< the River
Ouse,/>, whi<e the [[Strays of York stray/>s]] are<scattered around the ci/>ity in
marshy, low lying<places.

During Roman time/>s, the land surrounding the r<iver/>rs Ouse and <Foss was very
marshy, making />it easi<er to defend. The/>e city is prone to severe flooding fro<
the River Ouse, and has an e/>xtensive  but n<ot always effective /> network of flood
defen<es. Thes/>se include walls along the Ouse, and< a /> ba<rrier across the River
Foss where it/>t joins the Ouse.

The floo<s of late October and early Nov/>ember 2000, which were the hig<hest f/>or
over<350 ye/>ears, caused much damage, b<ut the water did not bre/>ach the  sandbag
reinforced  floo< walls. Much land within the ci/>ity has always been too fl<od 
prone for de/>evelopment.

York railwa<y station is situate/>d on<the East />Coast, Cros<s Country and
Tra/>nsPennine mainlin<es.
