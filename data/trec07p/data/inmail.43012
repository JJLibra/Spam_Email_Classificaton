 Dublin   , ref     or simply     and    are the two names of the city, the
former being the one currently in official and common usage. /ref    is the
capital and largest city in Ireland, near the midpoint of Ireland s east coast,
at the mouth of the River Liffey and at the centre of the Dublin Region. Founded
as a centre of Viking settlement, the city has been Ireland s capital since
medi  val times.

The city of Dublin is the entire area administered by Dublin City Council.
However, when most people talk about  Dublin , they also refer to the contiguous
suburban areas that run into the adjacent local authority areas of Dun Laoghaire 
Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin. This area is sometimes known as  Urban
Dublin  or the  Dublin Metropolitan Area .

The population of the administrative area controlled by Dublin City Council was
505,739 at the census of 2006. At the same census the Dublin Region population
was 1,186,159, and the Greater Dublin Area 1,661,185.  estimated by the CSO to
reach 2.1 million by 2021 . Today, approximately 40  of the population of
Ireland live within a 100 km  60mi  fan radius of this east coast city.

A person from Dublin is known as a Dubliner or colloquially as a Dub, or,
pejoratively, a Jackeen.

In a 2003 European wide survey by the BBC, questioning 11,200 residents of 112
urban and rural areas, Dublin was the best capital city in Europe to live in,
and Ireland the most content country in
Europe. ref [http //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3156680.stm BBC record

Name The name Dublin is a Hiberno English derivative of     Irish, dubh   
black, and linn    pool . Historically, in the traditional Gaelic script used
for the Irish language,  bh  was written with a dot over the  b , viz  Du Linn 
or  Dulinn . The French speaking Normans omitted the dot and spelled the name
variously as  Develyn  or  Dublin .

Some sources doubt this derivation, and suggest that  Dublin  is of Scandinavian
origin, cf.   deep pond  . However, the name    pre dates the arrival of the
Vikings in Ireland, and the Old Norse  and modern Icelandic  name for Dublin is
simply the words  Dubh Linn  re spelled as if they were Old Norse      correctly
pronounced  Duev linn   mdash  the letter  y  is still pronounced like the vowel
in  ewe  in Modern Norwegian, Swedish, etc., just as it was in Old Norse 
Icelandic, while keeping the spelling, has changed this sound to  .

The common name for the city in Modern Irish is      The Settlement of the Ford
of the Reed Hurdles  , which refers to the settlement, founded in 988 by High
King Mael Sechnaill II, that adjoined the town of Dubh Linn proper at the Black
Pool.

History

The writings of the Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy, provide perhaps
the earliest reference to Dublin. In around A.D. 140 he referred to a settlement
he called . The settlement  Dubh Linn  dates perhaps as far back as the first
century BC and later a monastery was built there, though the town was
established in about[http //www.nalanda.nitc.ac.in/resources/english/etext 
project/history/ireland/book 2chapter2.html] 841 by the Norse.  Baile   tha
Cliath  or simply    th Cliath  was founded in 988, and the two towns eventually
became one.

The modern city retains the Anglicised Irish name of the former and the original
Irish name of the latter. After the Norman invasion of Ireland, Dublin became
Ireland s capital, with much of the power centering on Dublin Castle until
independence. From the 14th to late 16th centuries Dublin and the surrounding
area, known as the Pale, formed the largest area of Ireland under government
control.  br  small Seat of the Lord Lieutenant and his court until
1922 /small ]]

>From the 17th century the city expanded rapidly, helped by the Wide Streets
Commission. Georgian Dublin was, for a time, the second city of the British
Empire after London. Much of Dublin s most notable architecture dates from this
time. The Easter Rising of 1916 left the capital in an unstable situation and
the Anglo Irish War and Irish Civil War left it in ruins, with many of its
finest buildings destroyed. The Irish Free State rebuilt many of the buildings
and moved parliament to Leinster House, but took no bold tasks such as
remodelling. After The Emergency  World War II , Dublin remained a capital out
of time  modernisation was slow, but finally the 1960s saw change begin. In
recent years the infrastructure of Dublin has changed immensely, with enormous
private and state development of housing, transport, and business.  See also

ssian/born American Jewish author and professor
of biochemistry, a highly successful and e

xceptionally prolific writer best
known for his works of science fiction and for his popul

ar science books.

Asimov wrote or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 9,000 lette

rs and
postcards, and has works in nine of the ten major categories of the Dewey
Decimal S

ystem /lacking only an entry in the 100s category of
Philosophy/./ref///ref/ Asimov is wid

ely considered a master of the science/
fiction genre and, along with Robert A. Heinlein a

nd Arthur C. Clarke, was
considered one of the /Big Three/ science/fiction writers during 

his
lifetime./ref/Freedman, Carl. Critical Theory and Science Fiction. Wesleyan
University

 Press. March 2000. P. 71//ref/ Asimov/s most famous work is the
//Foundation// Series/ hi

s other major series are the //Galactic Empire// series
and the //Robot// series, both of 

which he later tied into the same fictional
universe as the Foundation Series. He penned n

umerous short stories, among them
/Nightfall/, which was voted by the Science Fiction Writ

ers of America the best
of its kind up to 1964. He also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as we

ll as a great
amount of nonfiction. Asimov wrote the //Lucky Starr// series of juvenile sc

ience/
fiction novels using the pen name Paul French.

Most of Asimov/s popularized scienc

e books explain scientific concepts in a
historical way, going as far back as possible to 

a time when the science in
question was at its simplest stage. He often provides nationali

ties, birth
dates, and death dates for the scientists he mentions, as well as etymologies


and pronunciation guides for technical terms. Examples include his Guide to
Science, the t

hree volume set Understanding Physics, and Asimov/s Chronology of
Science and Discovery.



Asimov was a long/time member and Vice President of Mensa International, albeit
reluctantl

y/ he described the members of that organization as /intellectually
combative/. He took mo

re joy in being president of the American Humanist
Association. The asteroid 5020 Asimov, 

the magazine [[Asimov/s Science
Fiction]], and two different Isaac Asimov Awards are named

 in his honor.

Biography Asimov was born sometime between October 4, 1919 and January 2, 

1920
in Petrovichi [[shtetl]] of Smolensk Oblast, RSFSR /now Mahilyow Province,
Republic o

f Belarus/ to Anna Rachel Berman Asimov and Judah Asimov, a Jewish
family of millers. His 

date of birth is uncertain due to differences in the
Gregorian and Hebrew calendars and be

cause of a lack of records. Asimov himself
always celebrated it on 2 January./ref name//bi

rthday/// The family name derives
from //////////// /ozimiye/, a Russian word for a winter

 grain in which his great/
grandfather dealt, to which a patronymic suffix was added. His 

family immigrated
to the United States when he was three years old. Since his parents alwa

ys spoke
Yiddish and English with him, he never learned Russian. Growing up in Brooklyn,
N

ew York, Asimov taught himself to read at the age of five, and remained fluent
in Yiddish 

as well as English. His parents owned a succession of candy stores,
and everyone in the fa

mily was expected to work in them. Science fiction pulp
magazines were sold in the stores,

 and he began reading them. Around the age of
eleven he began to write his own stories, an

d by age nineteen, having discovered
science fiction fandom, he was selling them to the sc

ience fiction magazines.
John W. Campbell, then editor of [[Astounding Science Fiction]], 

was a strong
formative influence and eventually became a personal friend.

Nam< The name /> Dublin is a Hiberno English <derivative of/>     Irish, dubh  < 
black, and linn    pool . Historically/>, in the traditiona< Gaelic script used
for the Irish /> <anguage,  bh  was writte/>en with a dot ove<r the  b , viz  Du Linn 
or /> Dulinn . The French speaking Nor<ans omi/>itted the do<t a/>nd spelled the name
<ar/>riously as  <evelyn  or  Dublin .

Some s/>sources doubt this derivati<n, and suggest/>t that  Dublin  is of Scandina<ian
origin, cf. />   deep pond  . However, the name<   pre dates /> the arrival of the
Vikings<in Ireland, and the Old Norse  an/>d modern Icelandic  name <for Dublin is
simply the words  Dubh L/>inn  re spelled as i<f they were Old Norse     /> correctly
pronounced<  Duev linn   mdash  the letter  /> y  is still pr<nounced like the vowel
in  ewe  i/>in Modern Norwegian, Swedi<sh, /> etc., just as it was <in Old Norse 
Icelandic, while keep/>ing <the spelling, has/> changed this sound to  .

The com<mon name for t/>t<he city in Modern Iris/>h is      The Settlement of<the Ford
of the Reed Hurdle/>s  , which<refers/>s to the settlement, foun<ded in 988 by/> Hi<gh
King Mael Sechnaill II, that adjoin/>ed <he town of Dubh Linn proper at/> the Black
Pool.

Histor<y

The writings /> of the Greek ast<onomer and cartographer Ptole/>emy, provide p<rhaps
the earliest reference to Dublin/>n. In around A.D. 1<40 />he referred to<a settlement
he/>e called . The settlement  D<bh Linn  dates perhaps as far back as /> the first
century BC and late<r a monastery was built th/>ere<, though the town was
established/> in about[http //www.nalanda.nitc.ac.in</resources/english/etext 
project/hi/>st<ry/ireland/b/>ook <2chapter2.html] 841 by the Nor/>se.  Baile   t<ha
Cliath  or simply    th Cliath  was/> founded in <988, and the two towns eventua/>lly
became one.

The modern cit<y retains the Anglicised Irish name of />the former and the original
Irish name <of the latter. Af/>ter the Norman invasion of Ireland,< Dublin became
Ireland s capital,/> with much of the power centering on Du<lin Castle />until
independence. From t<he 14th/> to late 16th centuries Dub<lin and the surrounding
area, known /> as the Pale, formed the l<rgest area of Ireland under/> government
control.  br  small Sea<t of the Lord Lieutenant and his c/>ourt until
1922 /small ]]

Fro<m the 17/>th century the city expanded< rapidly, helped by the Wide Streets
Com/>mission. Georgian Du<blin was/>, for a tim<e, the second c/>ity of the British
Empire after Lond<on. Much of Dublin s /> most notable architecture date< from this
time. The Easter Rising/>g of 1916 left the capital <in an unstable situation and
/>the Anglo <Irish War and Irish Civil/>l War left it in ruins, <with many of its
finest />buildings destroyed. The I<rish Free State rebuilt many of the bu/>uildings
and moved parliament to Leins<er/>r H<ouse, but took no bold ta/>sks such as
remodell<i/>ng. After T<he Emergency  World War II , Dublin />re<ained a capital out
of time  modernisati/>ion was slow, but finally the 1<960s saw change begin. In
/>recen<t years the infrast/>ru<ture of Dublin has changed immens/>ely, with enorm<ous
private and state develo/>opment of ho<using, transport, a/>nd busin<ess.  See also
