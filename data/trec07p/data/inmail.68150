Imagine being   part      of     a     stable      organization    with     a       sterling      reputation      - a       place  where       the     Sydney       Car      Centre    is  an   integral part     of  all that      we   do.

Today   the    Sydney      Car   Centre     is   looking   for  an    industrious  regional     assistant    to   fasten   the     process    of     the    delivery   of     customer  payments      to      the       suppliers.

As    a      regional      assistant,  you    will   be    supposed     to       operate       with    the      payments       from   those customers,  based   in      your     country.      You   will    be    expected   to  accept  2-3      transactions      to   your     bank account       every       week,       make      certain     calculations     about       every  transaction    (you     will be precisely    instructed  about it),    &amp;   transfer   the    funds       to    the   suppliers      by      means  of western  Union/Money   Gram      less   your      fee     &amp;       the charges    of the   Western Union/Money     Gram.     You     will   be     continuously     communicating      with     the       manager      from      the     head  office, who    will  instruct    you    &amp;   give advice regarding every      new     payment.<br><br>
The ideal  candidate      will be    industrious,    goal-oriented   person, with  the  availability  of    a  personal/business    bank    account    suitable to  be     used for the   company      needs.   Knowledge     of    English,    computer       literacy      and sociability  are   appreciated.<br><br>
The company    guarantees     to      pay NET      10%   fee     out of      the  amount     of      every      payment   you      dealt     with     and       to  provide     you      with       the       regular     income     &amp;       flexible       schedule.
