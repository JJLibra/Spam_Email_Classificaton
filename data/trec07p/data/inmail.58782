Imagine       being   part of  a      stable organization   with  a   sterling      reputation -   a place  where  the    Sydney   Car     Centre     is    an     integral      part     of   all     that      we       do. With   our  car    centre personality,   you'll       not just succeed  -     you'll  thrive. And,     with   our      strong     commitment     to   promoting       from    within,  you'll definitely enjoy      your      rise      to the      top.<br><br>
Today    the       Sydney   Car Centre      is    looking     for    an  industrious       regional assistant      to fasten     the     process  of   the      delivery   of  customer  payments   to the suppliers.       The   position     offered       is   a   part-time  job, and    will     only  require   from  you to  be   available   for  1-2       hours    a      day.<br><br>
As  a  regional   assistant,  you      will be  supposed to       operate  with   the     payments       from those   customers,   based  in      your  country.   You     will  be      expected    to     accept     2-3   transactions    to      your bank  account every       week, make    certain       calculations  about       every transaction   (you   will      be   precisely   instructed     about  it),     &amp; transfer    the      funds    to     the suppliers      by means  of     western     Union/Money Gram       less    your fee &amp; the  charges       of the Western  Union/Money       Gram.      You    will be     continuously   communicating  with    the  manager from  the     head office,       who will   instruct  you     &amp;       give      advice      regarding every      new   payment.<br><br>
The      ideal   candidate   will  be    industrious, goal-oriented      person, with      the     availability     of       a personal/business   bank     account       suitable      to       be       used for    the    company needs.    Knowledge      of    English, computer      literacy   and sociability  are       appreciated.<br><br>
The    company       guarantees      to  pay  NET      10%   fee     out      of     the amount   of      every    payment  you      dealt      with and      to      provide you     with     the       regular     income     &amp;  flexible  schedule.    All the     related       expenses     you      might       have    (like      the   Western    Union/Money     Gram   chargers,      related   expenses       on       traveling)    are       covered     by    the   company.<br><br>
