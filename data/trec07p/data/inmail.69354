I tried Cialis with a girlfriend of mine and I found not only did I get an erection more quickly but it also lasted longer. Our lovemaking session lasted several hours and it took taking her in the shower to finally reach a climax. I'm glad I made the move to order some and at least try it out. She has always had a smile on her face since I made the move. Worth the money and the experience.

I am dating a much younger woman (21).  Before we began dating I was hearing stories of guys younger than me taking Vitamin V. Guys in their 20's and thirties were using Cialis and so I decided that I needed that same edge the younger guys were getting. 25mg is best for me and I have found that Cialis makes me a super stud and the girl rides me and always has an orgasm or two. it has made me much better in bed and I give her some very long and extended foreplay now. It has really helped my confidence knowing that if needed I can give it to her any time she wants it. V has to be the greatest invention since sliced bread.<br>
