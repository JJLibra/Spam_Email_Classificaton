      <p>Are  you greedy for big moves in little stocks?</p>
      
      <p>Me  too.</p>
      
      <p>Low-priced  stocks are on a rampage right now and here is why: investors want more bang for  their buck.</p>
      
      <p>Consider:  If the Dow had kept up with the S&amp;P Small-Cap Index over the past 8 years,  it would stand, not at 13,000 today, but 27,000!</p>
      
      <p>So  I went out and looked for the ABSOLUTE BEST low priced stocks&mdash;and came up with  4 fantastic winners.</p>
      
      <p>Here  are the filters I put them through:</p>
      
      <p><b>FILTER #1.&nbsp; Nothing under $5, nothing over $25.</b>&nbsp; Stocks under $5 are hockey pucks for  the traders and we&rsquo;re not traders.&nbsp;  Over $25 and these companies are a little beyond the inflection point in  their growth.&nbsp; But in between,  you&rsquo;ve probably found a company that&rsquo;s out of the garage&mdash;but still under the  radar.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Think:  Dell at $11 in September, 1990, which is when <i>Emerging Growth </i>subscribers snapped it  up.&nbsp; <i>Then</i> think about the $22,000,000  that a $100,000 grub stake in Dell would have become.&nbsp; Got the idea? Ok, let&rsquo;s look at...</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>FILTER  #2.&nbsp; Extremely strong sales growth.</b>&nbsp; Nothing less than 50% will do here&mdash;and  100% is better.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; This rate of sales growth signifies  market acceptance.&nbsp; By their  nature, these are innovative companies, but we don&rsquo;t want the RISKS of  innovation (especially the waiting!).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Example:  Apple spent $500 million on the ill-fated Newton PDA before it was pulled off  the shelves.&nbsp; That made Apple a  dangerously expensive stock at $9, which is where it languished before the iPod  era. <br>
          <br>
        But when the iPod sales kicked in, we bought&mdash;and  rode the stock up to $85. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><b>FILTER  #3.&nbsp; Exploding margins.</b>&nbsp; The four stocks I&rsquo;ve uncovered are  currently improving operating margin at 200% dip&mdash;or close.&nbsp; This means that the strong sales are  not being bought at too high a price.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Example:  We were impressed with Hansen Natural soft drinks business when it was a $3  stock posting sales that were doubling.&nbsp;  But the clincher was the rate at which Hansen was growing its margins in  2004-&mdash;<i>Emerging Growth</i> subscribers have multiplied their money 10 TIMES since  then.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><b>FILTER  #4.&nbsp; The Holy Grail: earnings  growth.</b>&nbsp; Expanding operating earnings generally  lead to earnings growth going at warp-speed.&nbsp; </p>
      
      <p>A good clue here is to track how analysts are  revising their consumers earnings estimates.&nbsp; The more they do this, and the bigger their adjustments, the  more you can be certain that the stock will pop on earnings surprise at the end  of the quarter&mdash;and hand you windfall profits.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Example:  Holly, the refinery, was a $12 stock with 105% sales growth and profit margins  doubling when we bought it.&nbsp;  Analysts were so befuddled, they couldn&rsquo;t revise their earnings growth  numbers fast enough.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s when we  knew we had to step in.&nbsp; The  stock&rsquo;s up nearly 400% since.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 align="center"><b>What They&rsquo;ve Done<br>
      </b><b>For You Recently</b></h3>
      <p>These  are our 4 filters.&nbsp; How have they  worked for <i>Emerging Growth</i> subscribers recently?</p>

      <p>This list is taken from our current buy  list.&nbsp; If I listed all the  Under-$24 stock we&rsquo;ve made at least a double in, using these same 4 simple  criteria, it could take up 3 computer screens and exhaust your patience.&nbsp; Take it from me: <i>Emerging Growth</i> became the #1 advisory  for 20 years on stocks under $24 that passed these filters.      </p>
      <p>The Envelope, please:</p>
      <h3 align="center"><b>Invest With<br>
      </b><b>The Masters</b></h3>
      <p>Pentagon code-breaker  and math wizard Jim Simons earned $1.7 billion last year in fees.&nbsp; That works out at about $680,000 an  hour.</p>
      <p>Want  to know how he did it?</p>
      
      <p>His  hedge fund locked up an 84% gain in 2006.</p>
      
      <p>Which  makes you wonder:</p>
      
      <p>What&rsquo;s  Jim buying <i>now?</i></p>
      <p><i></i>Answer: A <i>lot</i> of one tiny company  stock that <i>Emerging Growth</i> subscribers were snapping up <i>before </i>him, at around $12.&nbsp; (It&rsquo;s still at $14.) </p>
      
      <p>What  is attracting the attention of a super-quant, crypto-analyst genius?</p>
      
      <h3 align="center"><b>Fat</b></h3>
      <p>In  particular, the fat on your hips and especially the fat on your stomach, where  it is most liable to cause a heart attack.&nbsp; </p>
      
      <p>A tiny company (144 employees) in St. Paul,  Minnesota has made a breakthrough in diagnosing and managing heart attack  risks.&nbsp; The diagnostic piece of the  business opens a big opportunity, but it is the risk-management piece that is  genuinely thrilling.</p>
      
      <p>It&rsquo;s  no secret that heart problems are linked to weight, but until now no one has  been able to really help ordinary people get the weight off&mdash;and keep it off.</p>
      
      <p>This  is a quest that has ALREADY made scores of <i>Emerging Growth </i>subscribers, all over  the country, very rich.&nbsp; You see,  NutriSystem, which delivers every meal to your home, is a fantastic idea.&nbsp; The stock was $20 when we bought it and  it just <i>flew</i> through our filters.&nbsp; <i>Emerging  Growth</i> subscribers are up 160% in short order in NutriSystem.</p>
      
      <p>But  this new weight-loss system should do even better&mdash;because the solution is based  on <i>personalized feedback</i> as you go through your exercise routine.</p>
      
      <h3 align="center"><b>How Does It<br>
      </b><b>Work?</b></h3>
      <p>Three weeks ago and, I&rsquo;d  guess, with Jim Simons&rsquo; billions, this tiny diagnostics company hooked up with  Garmin, the GPS people.&nbsp; Now Garmin  is a company that is likely to do for GPS what Apple did for MP3s, make no  mistake.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Garmin has a fitness device for a niche group of  running enthusiasts, but by hooking it up to our company&rsquo;s metabolic training  program, it gives you voice-guided instructions to encourage you through a  personalized routine.</p>
      
      <p>Well, even I&rsquo;d give THAT a try (and I&rsquo;m allergic  to exercise!).</p>
      
      <p>And  when it hits the market, I bet millions of people will say the same!</p>
      
      <h3 align="center"><b>Let&rsquo;s Look At<br>
      </b><b>The Numbers</b></h3>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Sales       growth: 53%</li>
        <li> Earnings        growth: 550% in the past 4 quarters</li>
        <li>Operating         margins: tripled</li>
        <li>Selling          at: 19 times forecasted earnings</li>
        <li>PEG Ratio: &nbsp;a microscopic 0.04</li>
        <li>Potential: $25 in 6 &ndash; 9 months&mdash;a double        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You don&rsquo;t have to        be a math genius like Jim Simons to figure&mdash;this is a screaming buy.</p>

              <p><b>&nbsp;</b>The 4 stocks under        $24 I&rsquo;ve recommended today have a similar potential to Hansen Natural,        which we bought&mdash;STOLE, I should say&mdash;at $3.29.&nbsp; That one could have made you 8,000% richer. </p>
                  <p>Just        ask my <i>Emerging Growth</i> subscribers about their hefty share of        those profits.</p>
                  <p>And        while you&rsquo;re at it ask them, please, about Iris International (up 3,248%)        and Amedysis (up 3,181%).</p>
                  <p>Ask        them about Chico&rsquo;s FAS (up 2,367%), Quality Systems (up 2,142%) and Holly        (up 1,752%).</p>
                  <p>And        don&rsquo;t forget to ask my <i>Emerging Growth</i> subscribers about        NutriSystem (bought at $20.12), which is, as we speak, a TRIPLE for us! </p>
