 Arcadia  or  Arkad  a   Greek                 see also List of traditional
Greek place names  is a region of Greece in the Peloponnesus. It takes its name
from the mythological character Arcas.

Modern Arcadia Arcadia has its present day capital at Tripoli. It forms the
largest prefecture on the Peloponnesian peninsula. It currently covers about 18 
of the entire peninsula, although it once extended to about 20 to 25  of the
peninsula.

The prefecture has a skiing resort on Mount Maenalus, the Mainalon, located
about 20 km NW of Tripoli. The other mountains include the Parnon in the
southeast, the Artemisio, the Saita, the Skiathio, the Lykaia and Tsiberou.

The Greek National Road 7  E65  highway, which was extended after 1997 and in
2003, runs through Arcadia on a north west to south east axis and nearly forms
in the southwest the end of the highway. A thermoelectric power station which
produces electricity for most of southern Greece, operates to the south of
Megalopolis, along with a coal mine.

Arcadia has two tunnels. The Artemisio Tunnel opened first, followed by the
tunnel east of Megalopolis  both serve traffic flowing between Messenia and
Athens.

The chief cities and communities in the prefecture include Tripoli, Astros,
Vytina, Dimitsana, Lagkadia, Leonidio, Leontari, Levidi, Megalopolis Paloumba
and Stemnitsa.

In agriculture, potato farms, mixed farming, olive groves, and pasture dominate
the plains of Arcadia, especially in the area around Megalopolis and between
Tripoli and Levidi.

Theodoros Kolokotronis  1770   1843 , a general in the Greek War of Independence
 1821   1832 , lived in Arcadia.

Dimitris Plapoutas  1786 1864 , a general in the Greek War of Independence, also
lived in Arcadia.

Climate The climate consists of hot summers and mild winters in the eastern
part, the southern part, the low lying areas and the central area at altitudes
lower than 1,000 m. The area primarily receives rain during fall and winter
months in the rest of Arcadia. Winter snow occurs commonly in the mountainous
areas for much of the west and the northern part, the Taygetus area, the
Mainalon.

History    by Nicolas Poussin.]]

Due to its remote, mountainous character, Arcadia has always been a classical
refuge. So during the Dorian invasion, when Mycenaean Greek was replaced with
Doric Greek along the coast of the Peloponnes, it survived in Arcadia,
developing into the Arcadocypriot dialect of Classical Antiquity. Arcadocypriot
never became a literary dialect, but it is known from inscriptions. Tsan is a
letter of the Greek alphabet occurring only in Arcadia, shaped like Cyrillic    
it represents an affricate that developed from labiovelars in context where they
became t in other dialects. Tsakonian Greek , still spoken on the coast of the
modern prefecture of Arcadia, in the Classical period considered the southern
Argolid coast immediately adjoining Arcadia, is a descendant of Doric Greek, and
as such is an extraordinary example of a surviving regional dialect of archaic
Greek. The capital of Tsakonia is the Arcadian coastal town of Leonidio.

One of the birthplaces reported for Zeus is Mount Lycaeum in Arcadia. Lycaon, a
cannibalistic Pelasgian king, was transformed into a werewolf by Zeus. Lycaon s
daughter was Callisto. It was also said to have been the birthplace of Zeus 
son, Hermes.

Arcadia remained a rustic, secluded area, and its inhabitants became proverbial
as primitive herdsmen leading simple pastoral unsophisticated yet happy lives,
to the point that Arcadia may refer to some imaginary idyllic paradise,
immortalized by Virgil s Eclogues, and later by Jacopo Sannazaro in his pastoral
masterpiece, Arcadia  1504   see also Arcadia  utopia .

Arcadia later joined the Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire. In the early 
1st millennium, the area became a part of the Frankish Empire. In the mid 15th
century, the region fell into the hands of the Ottoman Turks with some
exceptions in the 16th century for a couple of years. During these periods, many
towns and villages were founded.

The Latin phrase [[Et in Arcadia ego]] which is usually interpreted to mean  I
am also in Arcadia  or  I am even in Arcadia  is an example of [[memento mori]],
a cautionary reminder of the transitory nature of life and t</STYLE>
