There is a high possibility that your PC's Firewall security settings may become exploited by malicious websites without your knowledge. This could easily lead to the following attacks on your PC's hard drive:

- Unwanted Virus Downloads
- Uncontrollable Trojan horse attacks
- The running of unwanted script programs
- The installation of malicious spyware

If your PC is not protected correctly then these attacks could allow hackers to track your movements across the Internet. It also means that your information, ranging from passwords to credit card numbers, can be stored by sites that you visit. A successful hacker could examine this information and extract it, setting the stage for identity theft, credit card fraud, or worse.

Press here for more information on how to make certain you are protected:

Some unknown or untrusted websites use script programs to change your home page, modify your web history, display advertisements, disable your back button, or redirect you to different websites without your consent. Such scripts have also been recently used by Russian hackers to silently install viruses on end-user's computers. 

One way to protect your PC is to download this new FIREWALL software program.
