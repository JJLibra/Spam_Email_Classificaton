Dear valued member.
I wanted to advise you on which Web pharmacy to choose to save your time and money without having to risk your health.
Recently, a research aimed at monitoring the quality of the drugs sold at the most popular online pharmacies has been made. The results of this research were rather surprising. Only one out of 53 Web drugstores – USDrugs – has proved its meds to be 100% generic.
Please, be more discerning when choosing your Web pharmacy.
