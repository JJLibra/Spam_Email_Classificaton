I was hesitant about using Viagra. Had a prescription for 6 months before I filled it and a couple of weeks before I used it. Since then it has changed my wife's and my lives. 25mg begins to work in about 15 minutes to a half an hour and lasts for 3 hours or so, Able to have an erection and intercourse more than once in a few hours. Her climaxes are more intense than ever and whenever mine come they come, so to speak. Wish I could use it a few times a day. Lots of water when taking the pill helps alleviate stuffiness and slight headache. Wow!

I am sixty years old, and, for the last few years, I have been doing interesting things in order to maintain an erection. For example, I would view erotica, or trim the hairs in my pubic region to increase sensation during sex. Last week, with my wife's full knowledge and consent, I tried 25mg of Viagra with very satisfactory results. I told my wife that I had read that I should be very careful to be cuddly and loving when using Viagra. She just laughed and said, "Don't worry about THAT; it just feels good having something that big inside me".  I told her that I took half the recommended dose so that I wouldn't cause her discomfort.  She laughed again and blurted, "I like it big and hard, I'd be crazy if I didn't. Don't ever worry about taking too much".  I plan to put this stuff to the test, you can believe that.<br>
