Subject: Having more than one version of Perl module installed
To: beginners@perl.org
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Message-ID: <479324.6110.qm@web60121.mail.yahoo.com>


I am looking for a way to make it easier to install
and maintain more than one version of Perl module in
the system. Well, there used to be one module called
“only” but I think it’s kind of dead now, as its not
compatible with new release of “version” module (on
which only module depends on ).  Does anybody here
able to make “only” module work with the latest
release of “version” module? Or is there any other
module out there that can be used for this purpose?  
I really need to have it. Any help will really be well
appreciated. Thank you very much.
Arya
