<FONT  COLOR=cccc99><B>Joke 1</B> Those raccoons are not luggage<BR></FONT>
As migration approached, two elderly vultures doubted they could make the trip south, so they decided 
to go by airplane.
When they checked their baggage, the attendant noticed that they were carrying two dead raccoons. Do 
you wish to check the raccoons through as luggage? she asked. 
No, thanks, replied the vultures. They're carrion. <BR>
<FONT  COLOR=cccc99><B>Joke 2</B> What just happened here?<BR></FONT>
A military cargo plane, flying over a populated area, suddenly loses power and starts to nose down. 
The pilot tries to pull up, but with all their cargo, the plane is too heavy. So he yells to the 
soldiers in back to throw things out to make the plane lighter. They throw out a pistol. Throw out. 
shouts the pilot. So they throw out a rifle. They heave out a missile, and the pilot regains control.
He pulls out of the dive and lands safely at an airport. They get into a jeep and drive off. Pretty 
soon they meet a boy on the side of the road who's crying. They ask him why he's crying and he says A 
pistol hit me on the head.
They drive more and meet another boy who's crying even harder. Again they ask why and the boy says, A 
rifle hit me on the head.
They apologize and keep driving. They meet a boy on the sidewalk who's laughing hysterically. They ask 
him, Kid, what's so funny? The boy replies, I sneezed and a house blew up.
