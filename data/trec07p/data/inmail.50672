History


The site of Belfast has been occupied since the Bronze Age. The Giant s Ring, a
5000 year old henge, is located near the city, and the remains of Iron Age hill
forts can still be seen in the surrounding hills. It became a substantial
settlement in the 17th century after being settled by English and Scottish
settlers during the Plantation of Ulster. Belfast blossomed as a commercial and
industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries and became Ireland s pre 
eminent industrial city. ]]Industries thrived, including linen, rope making,
tobacco, heavy engineering and shipbuilding, and</STYLE>
