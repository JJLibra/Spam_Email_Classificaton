I could easily tell my friends that I have married a riddle. But it wasn't her; it was the system and the atmosphere in which we lived. In such a breath-hindering air, she was not only living alive but was keeping me alive as well. She had kept alive that precious feeling of love that had died in us. To remain alive in such a breathless air, she needed me and I desired her. That's why I never got tired of her strange acts. I couldn't leave her alone. If I had left her alone, I would have become alone as well.


Our intention is to offer to only those interested. If not the mechanizim is in place for you to decide.
