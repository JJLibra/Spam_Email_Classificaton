Mrs. Mary Obaseki,
Flat 8 Block 12 NNPC Quarters,
Victoria Island,
Lagos, Nigeria.

My Dear Friend,

I presume this letter will come to you as a surprise, but as things 
unfold, we will know each other better. I will start by introducing 
myself to you; I am Mrs. Mary Obaseki, the wife of Late Chief Jackson 
Gaius Obaseki, the Formal Group Managing Director and Chief Executive 
of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).

I am very sure that you will be of a good assistance after carefully 
reading my letter. For many years of marriage now between me and my 
late husband, I have not given birth, and this had really troubled my 
husband before his death.

This is as a result of so much respect attached to local Tradition 
Culture and Custom in there community, so my in-laws has decided 
maltreat me. In short to be sincere and honest with you, with the 
present situation of things now, my home look broken. I am being 
threaten daily by my supposed in laws to get me out from the home. 
This situation has really affected me psychologically, most of the 
time I am in the church to pray and rest myself, because there is no 
room for rest in my own home again.

As I am writing to you now, I am no longer assured of a home, hence I 
seek your urgent assistance and help me out, which I Know will go a 
long way in getting me settled down finally. I want to use this 
opportunity, since my late husband family has abandoned me because of 
childlessness, to move a huge sum of $6 million US Dollars into your 
custody for safe keeping, pending my arrival in your country. Be 
informed that this said amount was given to my husband before is death 
as gratification from some foreign oil companies he helped in securing 
Allocation for the Drilling of Crude Oil in Nigeria.

As a widow, i do not want to be exposed this to my in laws, so he gave 
me this money to deposit in a security company, this was when the 
going was okay between us, so that he can exonerate himself from the 
eyes of Government security operatives and the Civil Service 
Commission (CSC) which is the body that scrutinizes the activities of 
all civil servants in Nigeria as checks and balances for official 
misconduct.

To be sincere and honest with you, this money is never connected with 
drugs, money laundry, firearms and looting, which I believe might put 
fears in you and consequently withdrawing your help for security 
reasons. Hence the source of this said money is clean and clear. This 
money has been deposited as family treasures in a security company all 
i needed from you is that, you will stand and claim this fund from the 
security company.

Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. As soon as I 
receive your response and your willingness to help as regards to this, 
I will furnish you on the next line of action to take immediately.

I will start coming to meet you in your country. I promise to 
compensate you very well at the successful end, this is the guarantee 
I am giving you from my heart of heart that this transaction will not 
be more than 14 working days and it will be concluded because every 
necessary/vital arrangements has been put in place, take note. Your 
negative or positive response will be highly appreciated by me Thanks 
and God bless you and your family.

Yours Sincerely,
Mrs. Mary Obaseki
