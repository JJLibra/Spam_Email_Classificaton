 Curtin University of Technology  is a technology focused university with its
main campus at Bentley, southeast of Perth, the capital city of Western
Australia. It commenced operations with its current name in 1986, and was
previously known as the Western Australian Institute of Technology  WAIT . Its
current name is taken from the former Prime Minister of Australia, John
Curtin.[http //official.curtin.edu.au/history.html]

Curtin University of Technology is Western Australia s largest
university[http //about.curtin.edu.au/] with over 39,000 students, of which over
9,000 study offshore.[http //planning.curtin.edu.au/stats/overview.html] There
are five main divisions at Curtin  Business  Engineering, Science and Computing 
Health Sciences  Humanities  and Resources and Environment. While not considered
one of Australia s  big  research universities, Curtin has a growing reputation
for research success in specific
areas.[http //official.curtin.edu.au/history.html]

Curtin has become increasingly popular in mainland China in recent years, thanks
to accomplished marketing efforts. The Chinese premier Wen Jiabao chose to visit
Woodside funded hydrocarbon research facility on its campus during his visit to
Australia.[http //announce.curtin.edu.au/release2005/c05706.html]

History Prior to 1986, Curtin University was called the Western Australian
Institute of Technology  WAIT . WAIT was formed in 1966. Its nucleus comprised
the tertiary programs formerly conducted in the Perth Technical College which
opened in 1900. In 1969, three more institutions were merged with WAIT  The W.A.
School of Mines  originally opened in 1902 , the Muresk Agricultural College
 dating from 1926  and schools of physiotherapy and occupational therapy in
operation since the 1950s at Shenton
Park.[http //official.curtin.edu.au/history.html]

Upon becoming a university, Curtin became eligible to grant doctorates by
research, and to compete for research funding.

Merger plans

Curtin University of Technology and Murdoch University were engaged in a
feasibility study into the possibility of a merger  June
2005 .[http //announce.curtin.edu.au/release2005/c13605.html] However, on 7
November 2005, both institutions issued a press release that such a merger will
not be undertaken.[http //announce.curtin.edu.au/release2005/c24405.html]

/Reading/ is a process of retrieving and comprehending some form of stored
inf

ormation or ideas. These ideas are usually some sort of representation of
language, such a

s symbols to be examined by sight, or by touch /for example
Braille/. Other types of readi

ng may not be text/based, such as music notation
or pictograms. By analogy, in computer sc

ience, reading is acquiring of data
from some sort of computer storage.

Although reading 

is now a primary means for most people to receive information
this has been the case only 

for the last 150 years or so /mdash/ with some
exceptions only a small percentage of the p

opulation in any country was literate
before the industrial revolution.

You are reading a

t this very moment.

Rates

Rates of reading include reading for memorization /under 100 w

ords per minute
/wpm//, reading for learning /100/ndash/200 wpm/, reading for comprehensio

n
/200/ndash/400 wpm/, and skimming /400/ndash/700 wpm/. Reading for comprehension
is the 

essence of most people///s daily reading. Skimming is sometimes useful
for processing larg

er quantities of text superficially at a much lower level of
comprehension /below 50//.

A

dvice for the appropriate choice of reading rate includes reading flexibly,
slowing down w

hen the concepts are closer together or when the material is
unfamiliar, and speeding up w

hen the material is familiar and the material is
not concept rich. Speed reading courses a

nd books often encourage the reader to
continually speed up/ comprehension tests lead the 

reader to believe their
comprehension is constantly improving. However, competence in read

ing involves
the understanding that skimming is dangerous as a default habit.

Types and m

ethods

We can identify several types and methods of reading, with differing rates that
ca

n be attained for each, for different kinds of material and purposes/

//[[Subvocalization

/Subvocalized]]/ reading combines sight reading with internal
sounding of the words as if 

spoken. It can be a bad habit that slows reading and
comprehension, if applied to all read

ing material, but it can also be essential
for reading things like poetry or transcripts o

f oral speeches. //[[Speed
reading]]/ is a collection of methods for increasing reading sp

eed without an
unacceptable reduction in comprehension or retention. closely connected to 

speed
learning. //[[Proofreading]]/ is a kind of reading for the purpose of detecting
typo

graphical errors. One can learn to do it rapidly, and professional
proofreaders typically 

acquire the ability to do so at high rates, faster for
some kinds of material than for oth

ers, while they may largely suspend
comprehension while doing so, except when needed to se

lect among several
possible words that a suspected typographic error allows. //Structure/P

roposition/
Evaluation /SPE// method, popularized by Mortimer Adler in [[How to Read a
Boo

k]], mainly for non/fiction treatise, in which one reads a writing in three
passes/ /1/ fo

r the structure of the work, which might be represented by an
outline/ /2/ for the logical

 propositions made, organized into chains of
inference/ and /3/ for evaluation of the meri

ts of the arguments and
conclusions. This method involves suspended judgment of the work o

r its
arguments until they are fully understood. //Survey/Question/Read/Recite/Review
/[[S

Q3R]]// method, often taught in public schools, which involves reading
toward being able t

o teach what is read, and would be appropriate for
instructors preparing to teach material

 without having to refer to notes during
the lecture.

Skill development


Several methods

 of teaching and learning to read have developed, and become
somewhat controversial/

//[[

Phonics]]/ involves teaching reading by associating characters or groups of
characters wit

h sounds. Sometimes argued to be in competition with whole
language methods. //[[Whole lan

guage]]/ methods involve acquiring words or
phrases without attention to the characters or

 groups of characters that compose
them. Sometimes argued to be in competition with phonic

s methods, and that the
whole language approach tends to impair learning how to spell.

/W

hy Neither Phonics Nor Whole Language is Completely Successful/ In comparison
to other alp

habetic languages, neither the phonics nor the whole language method
is an unquestionably 

successful teaching method in the English language. This is
the reason that these methods 

are described above as being ///somewhat
controversial/// and the reason it is stated abov

e that the whole language
method ///tends to impair learning how to spell.///

Both the ph

onics and the whole word methods labor to overcome what is actually a
defect in the writte

n representation of the English language. Contrary to the
logical purpose of an alphabetic

 language, the letters used to spell the words
in English have been effectively divorced f

rom the sounds used in pronouncing
the words. This is due primarily to a serious error mad

e by Dr. Samuel Johnson
when he prepared his dictionary of the English language in 1755. A

lthough there
had been other dictionaries prior to Johnson///s dictionary, none of them we

re
as widely accepted and as authoritative as Johnson///s dictionary.
