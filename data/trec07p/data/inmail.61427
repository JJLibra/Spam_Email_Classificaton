Imagine being       part   of     a     stable    organization with      a   sterling    reputation  -  a      place       where     the Sydney   Car    Centre    is   an      integral     part     of   all      that   we     do.

Today   the       Sydney       Car  Centre    is     looking    for     an   industrious  regional    assistant to     fasten      the  process  of the     delivery       of       customer    payments      to      the   suppliers.  The      position      offered       is    a       part-time   job,    and  will     only       require  from   you   to       be    available   for       1-2 hours      a       day.<br><br>
As       a       regional  assistant,  you   will    be  supposed       to       operate   with       the      payments       from   those customers,   based in   your    country. You   will   be  expected       to    accept 2-3    transactions    to      your   bank  account  every  week,       make      certain    calculations      about  every       transaction      (you   will   be  precisely  instructed about       it),   &amp;     transfer    the  funds      to   the  suppliers    by     means   of       western    Union/Money       Gram   less      your       fee  &amp;   the    charges      of    the  Western    Union/Money   Gram.    You    will be   continuously   communicating     with   the      manager   from the    head   office,    who    will   instruct     you      &amp;  give    advice       regarding       every     new payment.<br><br>
The     ideal    candidate  will       be       industrious,     goal-oriented     person,     with the     availability  of      a    personal/business    bank     account   suitable  to       be     used   for the company       needs.
