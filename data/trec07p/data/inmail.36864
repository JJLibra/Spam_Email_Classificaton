<=21--WASHINGTON - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales confidently deflected House Demo=
crats' demands Thursday for details in the firings of U.S. attorneys, appearing ever more=
 likely to survive accusations that the dismissals were politically motivated.=20

Republican lawmakers rushed to Gonzales' defense as the attorney general denied anew tha=
t the firings last year were improper.

The mostly muted five-hour hearing in front of the        House Judiciary Committee was a sharp co=
ntrast to Gonzales' sometimes testy appearance three weeks ago when Senate Republicans q=
uestioned his competence to run the Justice Department. One senator at that session joine=
d a small GOP chorus saying he should step down.

=22I will work as hard as I can, working with this committee and working with DOJ employees,=
 to reassure the American people that this department is focused on doing its job,=22 Gonza=
les said Thursday.

That did not satisfy exasperated Democrats, who accused Gonzales of being evasive.

=22Your reputation is on the line, Mr. Attorney General. What do you have to say for yoursel=
f?=22 asked Rep. Maxine Waters (news, bio, voting record), D-Calif., adding that the =
=22buck stops at the top.=22

=22I accept responsibility,=22 Gonzales answered.

       President Bush steadfastly has stood by Gonzales, his longtime counselor and friend. Eve=
n career Justice Department staffers angered by the attorney general's response to the fi=
rings acknowledge Gonzales appears to have beaten back calls to leave.

The latest lawmaker to urge Gonzales to quit was Rep. Adam Schiff (news, bio, voting record=
), D-Calif. =22I hope you will resign because the department is broken and I don't think you=
're the one to fix it,=22 Schiff told him.

Republicans sought to portray the controversy as losing steam. They pushed Democrats to w=
rap up the congressional probe that has dogged the department since the beginning of the ye=
ar.

=22The list of accusations has mushroomed, but the evidence of wrongdoing has not,=
=22 said Rep. Lamar Smith (news, bio, voting record) of Texas, top Republican on the commit=
tee. =22If there are no fish in this lake, we should reel in our lines of questions, dock our e=
mpty boat and turn to more pressing issues.=22

Gonzales acknowledged low morale at the department. Career prosecutors have said it is st=
unting hiring. Private defense lawyers say it has led to government hesitation and indeci=
siveness in some courtrooms. Gonzales contended the department's independence is intac=
t.

=22Contrary to being gun shy, this process is somewhat liberating in terms of going forwar=
d,=22 he said.
