        Dear Reader,

        Some agreements can be seen not just on their future or
        present profit value, but also as bold 'coming-of-age'
        affirmations. In the case of i-level Media Group (OTC
        BB:ILVL.OB - News), having major international brands
        jump on board testifies to i-level's increasingly broad
        media reach in China.

        News released this morning seems to signal that the
        company's arsenal of media screens in Chinese cabs --
        all of which target a favorable consumer demographic --
        is now large enough for the Eli Lilly's and
        Monster.com's. It's clear that i-level is looking to
        attract an increasing number of Fortune 500 companies
        and major Chinese brands in the near term.    (See

           The affluent and the upper middle class get around
                            Shanghai in taxis

        These individuals are eager to become integrated in the
        global economy and to enjoy the living standards of
        developed nations. This in turn has been a catalyst for
        rapid growth in the demand for fast-moving consumer
        goods and higher-end products and services.
        Consequently, producers of such goods and services are
        clamoring for effective media to reach this emerging
        middle class and tap into its fast-growing buying
        power. i-level meets this need by providing an
        innovative and exciting medium that effectively targets
        these individuals.

        i-level is well positioned for rapid expansion with
        870,000 taxis in major cities across China – and
        accessing a direct channel to China’s most affluent,
        mobile audience with higher than average disposable
        incomes. Management at i-level projects 25-fold revenue
        growth to 2009 through out-of-home digital advertising
        in China.

        Press Release Source: i-level Media Group
        Tuesday June 5, 8:00 am ET

            i-level Media Group Announces the Opening of Its
                             Beijing Office

        BEIJING, June 5, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- i-level Media
        Group Inc. (OTC BB:ILVL.OB - News) announced the
        official opening of its branch office in Beijing today,
        marking the Company's first major step in extending its
        presence beyond the city of Shanghai.

        Beijing is China's second largest media market in
        addition to being an especially hot market in the short
        term due to the upcoming 2008 Olympic Summer Games. The
        Company's new Beijing office will enable it to more
        easily market its digital media network to the many
        major advertisers and global brands whose China
        operations are headquartered there. The i-level office
        is located in the city's central business district of
        Chaoyang, providing for easy access to all prospective
        clients in the city.

        "With over 60,000 taxis currently in service in this
        city, and the 2008 Olympics coming very soon, Beijing
        is an ideal market for our media,'' noted i-level's
        President and CEO, Aidan Sullivan. "We intend to
        establish a significant presence here in time to
        capture a portion of the massive ad spend that is
        expected around the period of the Olympics next year."

<p>Dear Reader,
<p>Some agreements can be seen not just on their future or present profit
value, but also as bold 'coming-of-age' affirmations. In the case of <b>i-level
Media Group (OTC BB:ILVL.OB - News)</b>, having major international brands
jump on board testifies to i-level's increasingly broad media reach in
China.
<p>News released this morning seems to signal that the company's arsenal
of media screens in Chinese cabs -- all of which target a favorable consumer
demographic -- is now large enough for the Eli Lilly's and Monster.com's.
It's clear that i-level is looking to attract an increasing number of Fortune
500 companies and major Chinese brands in the near term.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
