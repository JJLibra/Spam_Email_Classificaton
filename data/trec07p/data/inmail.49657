<=21--SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - A Saudi Arabian detainee died Wednesday at Guantanamo Bay pr=
ison and the U.S. military said he apparently committed suicide. Critics of the detention=
 center said the death showed the level of desperation among prisoners.=20

Also Wednesday, a Canadian detainee fired his American attorneys, leaving him without de=
fense counsel ahead of his trial, his former U.S. military attorney told The Associated Pr=
ess. The detainee, Omar Khadr, is still to be arraigned and is one of only three of the roughl=
y 380 Guantanamo prisoners to be charged with a crime.

The military did not identify the detainee who died or describe the manner of death. There a=
re about 80 detainees from Saudi Arabia held at Guantanamo.

Guards at the U.S. Naval Base in southeast Cuba found the detainee unresponsive and not bre=
athing in his cell Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a sta=
tement.

=22They tried to save his life but he was pronounced dead,=22 said Mario Alvarez, a Miami-b=
ased spokesman for the command.

Lawyer Julia Tarver Mason, whose firm represents eight Saudi detainees at Guantanamo, sa=
id she has tried so far without success to learn from the government if the apparent suicide=
 was by one of her clients.

=22They are in the care of the United States government and that should mean that deaths sho=
uld not occur,=22 Mason said.

It would be the fourth suicide at Guantanamo since the prison camp opened in January 2002. O=
n June 10, 2006, two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with sheets.

A spokesman for detention operations, Navy Cmdr. Rick Haupt, declined to comment, referr=
ing questions to the Miami-based Southern Command, which oversees U.S. military operati=
ons in the Caribbean and Latin America.

Defense attorneys said the death was likely an act of desperation at a prison camp where det=
ainees are denied access to U.S. civilian courts and isolated in their cells for up to 22 hou=
rs a day.
