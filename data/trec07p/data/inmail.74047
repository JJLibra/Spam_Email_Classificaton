Imagine being  part   of  a  stable  organization       with       a  sterling   reputation    -      a   place    where     the    Sydney   Car   Centre is     an    integral       part   of     all       that we       do.      With      our   car     centre      personality,    you'll   not   just      succeed   - you'll      thrive. And,     with    our    strong       commitment to    promoting      from  within, you'll definitely  enjoy  your rise     to  the       top.<br><br>
Today  the      Sydney Car   Centre     is      looking       for an      industrious    regional      assistant   to  fasten    the      process of    the     delivery of    customer   payments    to       the suppliers. The     position    offered  is   a   part-time       job,  and      will      only       require     from       you      to       be available   for     1-2 hours a     day.<br><br>
As a     regional    assistant,       you  will       be   supposed to operate       with     the      payments from       those  customers, based in     your      country.    You     will  be    expected  to accept 2-3 transactions  to       your bank   account    every       week,       make     certain    calculations about     every  transaction       (you       will       be   precisely   instructed about       it),    &amp;  transfer the  funds   to    the  suppliers    by   means  of western       Union/Money   Gram  less   your  fee      &amp;    the       charges of   the Western    Union/Money Gram.      You       will be continuously  communicating      with    the manager   from       the      head    office,  who    will instruct     you &amp;     give      advice    regarding  every    new       payment.<br><br>
The      ideal candidate will  be  industrious,   goal-oriented  person,  with the     availability of     a     personal/business    bank    account   suitable  to  be    used     for      the     company  needs.  Knowledge  of       English, computer     literacy   and   sociability  are     appreciated.<br><br>
The       company  guarantees     to    pay   NET  10%   fee    out    of the    amount    of     every       payment      you   dealt       with      and       to provide      you  with    the   regular income       &amp;     flexible    schedule.     All    the     related   expenses you      might    have   (like       the   Western       Union/Money    Gram    chargers,  related       expenses on  traveling)       are     covered       by      the    company.<br><br>
