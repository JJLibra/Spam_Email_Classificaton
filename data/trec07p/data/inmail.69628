Foundation's Officer, 
Stitching INGKA Foundation, 
The Netherlands. 
http://www.ikea.nl/ 

Dear Sir/Madam, 

NOTIFICATION FOR CASH AID. 

This is to notify you that you have been chosen By the Board of trustees of
the above International charity organization based in the Netherlands as one
of the final recipients of a Cash Grant/Donation for your own personal,
education and business development 

The Dutch-registered Stitching INGKA Foundation is named after Kamprad, and
owns INGKA Holding, the parent company for all IKEA stores. The charitable
foundation was reported by the business newspaper, the Economist in May 2006
to be technically the world's wealthiest charity - with an estimated value
of at least US$36 billion in 2006 (larger than the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation) - but its primary purpose is, by some, believed to be corporate
tax-avoidance and anti-takeover protection for IKEA.Kamprad is chairman of
the foundation. Having been rated as the biggest charity foundation in
Europe for the year 2007, the foundation has decided to randomly select
email addresses that would benefit from this year's donation/award.

Stitching INGKA Foundation in conjunction with the United Nations
Organization (UNO) and the European Union is giving out a yearly donation of
One Hundred Million United States Dollars as specific Donations/Grants to 50
lucky international recipients worldwide in different categories for their
educational pursuit, health care, personal Business development and uplift
of their environment. These funds are freely given to you to use for your
business educational and personal development and at least 30% to be used by
you to develop a part of your environment, as this is a yearly program,
which is a measure of universal development strategy, and eradication of
poverty. 

Please kindly note that you are not the only beneficiary in your country
this year and your country is not the only country that is benefiting from
this donation, as beneficiaries have been chosen from countries from all
continents. 

The idea of this donation is that within ten years from now, there will be
notable richness among many unusual people around the world. 

This will give many people the opportunity to get their lives to a stage
where they had always wanted. Kindly note that you will only be chosen to
receive the donation once. which means that, subsequent yearly donation will
not get to you again, so it's your choice to spend the donation wisely on
something that will last you a long time. And please do not bother following
up this email, if you have benefited from this donation in previous years. 

Based on the random selection exercise of internet service providers(ISP)
and millions of Super market cash invoices worldwide, you were selected
among the lucky recipients to receive the award sum of US$2,000,000.00(Two
Million United States Dollars) as charity donations/aid from the Stichting
INGKA Foundation and the UNO in accordance with the enabling act of
Parliament.Note that, your email was selected from either the internet, or a
Shop's cash invoice around your area in which you might have purchased
something from. 

You are required to expeditiously Contact the Executive Secretary below for
qualification documentation and processing of your claims, from Monday
through Sunday. 

On contact with this officer, you'll be given your donation pin number
which you will use in collecting the funds. 

Please endeavor to quote your Qualification numbers (N-222-6747, E-900-56)
in all discussions. 

Executive Secretary, 
Mr. Lester Whalley, 
Tel: +31-623-865-120
Fax: +31-847-291-150
Email: ikeafoundation2007@yahoo.es

Please note that these donations/Grants are strictly administered by
"European Union" under delegated powers from the UNO. you are by all means
hereby advised to keep this whole information confidential until you have
been able to collect your donation, as there have been many cases of double
and unqualified claim, due to beneficiaries informing third parties about
his/her donation. 

Finally, all funds should be claimed by their respective beneficiaries, not
later that 15 days after notification, as failure to do so will be to that
particular beneficiary cancelled and its donation reserved for next years
receipients. 

On behalf of the Board kindly accept our warmest congratulations 

Yours Sincerely,
Mrs. Lissa M. Bauldry
(Foundation officer)
