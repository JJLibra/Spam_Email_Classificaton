 Anne Bradstreet   ca. 1612     September 16, 1672  was the first American
female writer, and the first American female poet to have her works published.

Life and writing Bradstreet was born as  Anne Dudley  in Northampton, England.
She was the daughter of Thomas Dudley, a steward of the Earl of Lincoln, and
Dorothy Yorke. ref  /ref  Due to her family s position she grew up in cultured
circumstances. At the age of sixteen she married Simon Bradstreet. Both Anne s
father and Anne s husband were later to serve as governors of the Massachusetts
Bay Company. Anne and Simon, along with Anne s parents, emigrated to America
aboard the [[Arbella]] during the  Great Migration  in 1630. ref
name  VCU  Woodlief, A.  n.d. .
[http //www.vcu.edu/engweb/webtexts/Bradstreet/bradbio.htm Biography of Anne
Bradstreet]. Retrieved September 1, 2006. /ref 

Bradstreet was an unusually well educated woman for her time, which allowed her
to express herself through writing. She wrote about politics, history, medicine,
and theology. Her personal library of books was said to have numbered over 800,
many of which were destroyed when her home burned down on July 10, 1666. This
event itself inspired a poem entitled   , wherein Bradstreet rejects the worldy
tragedy which has befallen her family and looks toward God and afterlife as
consolation.

Much of Bradstreet s poetry is based on observation of the world around her,
focusing heavily on domestic and religious themes. Long considered primarily of
historical interest, she won critical acceptance in the 20th century as a writer
of enduring verse, particularly for her sequence of religious poems
 Contemplations , which was written for her family and not published until the
mid 19th century. ref n. a.  2000 .

Bradstreet s work was deeply influenced by poet Guillaume du Bartas, who was
favoured by 17th century readers.

In 1647 Bradstreet s brother in law, Rev. John Woodbridge, sailed to England,
carrying her manuscript of poetry  possibly without her knowledge . Anne s first
work was published in London as  The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America, by
a Gentlewoman in such Parts . ref name  VCU /  The purpose of the publication
appears to have been an attempt by devout Puritan men  [[i.e.]] Thomas Dudley,
Simon Bradstreet, John Woodbridge  to show that a godly and educated woman could
elevate the position held by a wife and mother, without necessarily placing her
in competition with men.

Anne Bradstreet was born in Northampton, England, in the year 1612, daughter of
Thomas Dudley and Dorothy Yorke  Dudley, who had been a leader of volunteer
soldiers in the English Reformation and Elizabethan Settlement, was then a
steward to the Earl of Lincoln  Dorothy was a gentlewoman</STYLE>
