Dear valued member.
We are sure that your health isn’t the least thing you care of – so, please, read the valuable piece of advice our Association offers you.
Recently, a research aimed at monitoring the quality of the drugs sold at the most popular online pharmacies has been made. The results of this research were rather surprising. Only one out of 53 Web drugstores – USDrugs – has proved its meds to be 100% generic.
Remember! Taking generic drugs you will secure yourself against poisoning!
