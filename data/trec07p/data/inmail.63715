Religious Issues

Shapiro said his software is most similar to the Internet TV service Joost, launched by the creators of Skype, an Internet calling program, and Kazaa, a file-sharing program. Both Veoh and Joost use peer-to-peer technology to deliver video.

On Wednesday, the military said it had recovered 25 to 30 bodies after destroying three "satellite camps" in the eastern Thoppigala region overnight. "We are now clearing mines in the area," said Brig. Prasad Samarasinghe, a military spokesman. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had called Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso to tell him about Hill's visit to Pyongyang, said Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki at a news conference.

The mosques, all located in Babil province -- parts of which comprise the violence-wracked Triangle of Death -- were attacked Tuesday night, hours after the bombing outside Khalani Mosque, police in Hilla said. 
"Video today does not have a killer desktop application and that's what Veoh TV aims to be," Veoh Chief Executive Dmitry Shapiro told The Associated Press. "It's a new type of browser made specifically for video."
Since then, Blackstone made headlines by disclosing that Schwarzman made $400 million in 2006 and could walk away from the IPO with a stake in the company valued at as much as $7.7 billion.

But he liked the idea of the Great Firewall voodoo doll.
"The thirst for information in China is so strong, it is very difficult for the (Communist) Party to stay ahead of the curve," Bequelin explained. A fragmented hard disk stores parts of a file in many different locations. To retrieve a file, the computer must search many areas on the disk. Defragmenting a disk places all the parts of a file in one location. This reduces the time the computer will spend locating the file. Windows 95 and MS-DOS 6.2 both include defragmenting software.

Alzheimer's Disease / Memory

London Stock Exchange said it was in talks over a possible tie-up with Borsa Italiana. LSE shares shed about 2 percent.

Yang's fury erupted a few days ago when he found he could not browse his friend's holiday snaps on Flickr.com, due to access restrictions by censors after images of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre were posted on the photo-sharing Web site.
The ban prompted one U.S. family group to start lobbying for a rating to ensure major American retailers cannot sell the game. In it, players become an insane asylum escapee sneaking up on enemies and killing them in gruesome ways.

Books / Literature

The three defendants convicted Wednesday in Freetown had pleaded not guilty to all the charges, which were linked to heading a junta that raped women, burned villages, conscripted thousands of child soldiers and forced others to work as laborers in diamond mines.

Shapiro said his software is most similar to the Internet TV service Joost, launched by the creators of Skype, an Internet calling program, and Kazaa, a file-sharing program. Both Veoh and Joost use peer-to-peer technology to deliver video. Veoh TV will display both user-generated videos from sites such as Google's YouTube as well as episodes streamed by major TV networks like ABC and Fox, organizing them in channels much the way a standard TV program guide does.

Since then, Google has steadily expanded upon the Internet's largest advertising network to create nearly $140 billion in shareholder wealth as its stock price increased by more than sixfold. Yahoo's stock, meanwhile, is worth a little bit less than when Google went public.

The free downloadable program will display streaming video full screen, complete with whatever advertising the creator has placed in them. It also will save videos from sites that allow downloading, although it won't access sites that sell videos. A fancy name for a set of instructions like adding 2 and 2. Software uses algorithms, which spell out how to do the simplest things in painful detail, because computers are still a little, you know, dumb.

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Government troops killed up to 44 separatist rebels in clashes in northern and eastern Sri Lanka while destroying three small camps in the insurgents' last eastern stronghold, the military said Wednesday. The guerrillas disputed the death toll figures. At least 75 people were wounded by the blast at the building, which house the polic
Although the cease-fire has been largely ignored, neither side has officially withdrawn from the truce fearing international criticism.

London Stock Exchange said it was in talks over a possible tie-up with Borsa Italiana. LSE shares shed about 2 percent. A way of connecting devices to a computer. EIDE can connect up to four devices, such as hard drives, CD-ROM drives, and tape drives. EIDE was developed to surpass its older brother IDE, which is slower and can only connect two hard drives. Most new computers come with EIDE. See also IDE
