     Hi rent,

     Just a quick reminder to let you 
     know that the Rent-A-List Special 
     promotion ends in 3 days - 
     Fri 29th at 12:00 Midnight.

     The promo link below will be active 
     for under 72 hours from now:

     => http://imttrack.com/t/c/msmedia/ral_sp/

     We continue to be amazed by the 
     response to our June Promotion and 
     would like to share some of the 
     comments we received:

     ------------------------------------
     Janette Marrett from Rediwealth.com...

     "Your the best advertising company 
     I've used yet as far as results for 
     me personally goes. A proven winner 
     to bring in leads and sales!" 
     ------------------------------------
     Danny Coschia from LYANAdvertising, LLC....

     "Happy? You bet! I am averaging 20-
     60 new sign-ups every time I place 
     an ad. And that has only been with 
     the smaller packages offered. I 
     can't wait to see what one of the 
     larger campaigns pull in." 
     ------------------------------------
     Scott Houge from Nutronix...

     "Happy, and satisfied would be the 
     word I would use when talking about 
     the results I have found here with 
     Rent a list.. And 13 people under 
     me agree it is a cheaper 
     advertising method that also 
     produces real people to my site, as 
     well as signups to my business. :)" 
     ------------------------------------
     David Portman from Portman Communications...

     "Yes, an above-average result in 
     response to our first venture with 
     you." 
     ------------------------------------

     In less than 72 hours Rent-A-List's 
     Advertising Mega Sale will end. 
     With it, up to 45% savings will 
     disappear.

     P.S. When every dollar counts, it's good to 
     know that there's one place you can go to 
     get your message out to thousands without 
     spending a lot of money.
