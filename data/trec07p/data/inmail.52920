And,   with our     strong   commitment to       promoting     from  within,    you'll definitely     enjoy   your    rise   to  the       top.<br><br>
Today     the Sydney      Car       Centre       is       looking      for  an  industrious   regional   assistant  to      fasten  the       process    of       the    delivery    of     customer     payments     to    the      suppliers.  The  position offered   is   a part-time    job, and will    only  require     from  you    to    be available     for 1-2      hours      a     day.<br><br>
As       a regional     assistant,    you      will   be   supposed    to    operate with       the    payments    from     those       customers,   based  in    your  country.     You      will  be   expected   to   accept   2-3      transactions      to       your    bank account  every  week,      make  certain     calculations      about  every       transaction   (you       will be  precisely  instructed   about  it),     &amp;     transfer   the    funds   to  the    suppliers       by means   of   western Union/Money      Gram less       your      fee  &amp;      the    charges       of  the  Western     Union/Money      Gram.      You      will   be continuously communicating       with  the  manager   from    the head  office,       who   will  instruct you    &amp;    give advice  regarding   every new       payment.<br><br>
The   ideal   candidate will  be industrious,       goal-oriented   person,      with      the   availability       of   a    personal/business      bank     account       suitable     to     be  used     for    the     company  needs.

All the     related    expenses    you     might   have     (like the  Western       Union/Money       Gram chargers,   related   expenses  on  traveling)      are     covered   by       the   company.<br><br>
