The  Bald Eagle    Haliaeetus leucocephalus  , also known in the United States
as the  American Eagle , is a bird of prey found in North America, most
recognizable as the national bird of the United States.

The species was on the brink of extirpation in the U.S. late in the twentieth
century, but now has a stable population and is in the process of being removed
from the U.S. federal government s list of endangered species. The Bald Eagle
was officially reclassified from  Endangered  to  Threatened  on July 12, 1995
by the U.S. Fish   Wildlife Service. On July 6, 1999, there was a proposal
initiated  To Remove the Bald Eagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of
Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.  The Rule has yet to be passed.[http //ecos

This sea eagle gets both its normal and scientific names from the distinctive
appearance of the adult s head. Bald in the English name is derived from the
word [[piebald]], and refers to the white head and tail feathers and their
contrast with the darker body. The scientific name is derived from Haliaeetus,
New Latin for  sea eagle,   from the Ancient Greek haliaetos  and leucocephalus,
Latinized Ancient Greek for  white head , from leukos   white   and kephale
  head  .

Description and systematics

An immature Bald Eagle has speckled brown plumage, the distinctive white head
and body developing 2 3 years later, before sexual maturity. This species is
distinguishable from the Golden Eagle in that the latter has feathers which
extend down the legs. Also, the immature Bald Eagle has more light feathers in
the upper arm area, especially around the  armpit .

Body length ranges from 27 to 40 inches  68 100 cm . Adult females have an
average wingspan of about 7 feet  2.1 meters   adult males have a wingspan of 6
ft 6 in  2 meters . Adult females weigh approximately 12.8 lb  5.8 kg , males
weigh 9 lb  4.1 kg . The smallest specimens are those from Florida, where an
adult male may barely exceed 5 lb  2.3 kg  and a wingspan of 6 feet  1.8
meters . The largest are the Alaskan birds, where large females may exceed 16.5
lb  7.5 kg  and have a wingspan of over 8 feet  2.4 meters .

The northern birds are the subspecies washingtoniensis, whereas the southern
ones belong to the nominate subspecies leucocephalus. They are separated
approximately at latitude 38   N, or roughly the latitude of San Francisco 
northern birds reach a bit further south on the Atlantic Coast, where they occur
south to the Cape Hatteras area. Audubon s type specimen of   Washington s
Eagle     named in honor of George Washington ref  As explicitly stated by
Audubon. However, the subspecific name he chose   washingtoniensis   means
properly  from Washington  state  . There has been considerable confusion, with
some authors changing it to washingtoni,   George  Washington s , but the form
as originally written is correct. /ref 
  was apparently an exceptionally large bird, such as are more often found in
  Alaska  these have been proposed as subspecies alascanus or alascensis, but
  the variation is clinal and follows Bergmann s Rule.

The Bald Eagle forms a species pair with the Eurasian White tailed Eagle. These
diverged from other Sea Eagles at the beginning of the Early Miocene  c. 10 mya 
at latest, possibly   if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to
this genus   as early as the Early/Middle Oligocene, some 28 mya  Wink et al.
1996 ref  The authors  reservations about using the generalized  2   rate of
molecular evolution have since proven to be well founded. /ref  . As in other
sea eagle species pairs, this one consists of a white headed  the Bald Eagle 
and a tan headed species. They probably diverged in the North Pacific, spreading
westwards into Eurasia and eastwards into North America. Like the third northern
species, Steller s Sea eagle, they have yellow talons, beaks and eyes in adults.

Bald Eagles are powerful fliers, and also soar on thermal convection currents.

In the wild, Bald Eagles typically live about 20 30 years, but can realize a
life span of approximately 50 years. They generally live longer in captivity, up
to 60 years.

Bald Eagles normally squeak and have a shrill cry, punctuated by grunts. They do
not make the  eagle scream , usually the call of a Red tailed Hawk, that is
sometimes dubbed into films for dramatic effect.

Range and habitat

The Bald Eagle s natural range covers most of North America, including most of
Canada, all of the continental United States, and northern Mexico. The bird
itself is able to live in most of North America s varied habitats from the
bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran desert and the eastern deciduous forests of
Quebec and New England. It can be a migratory bird but it also is not unheard of
for a nesting pair to overwinter in its breeding area.

Bald Eagles will also congregate in certain locations in winter. From November
until February, between one and two thousand birds winter in Squamish, British
Columbia, about halfway between Vancouver and Whistler. The birds primarily sit
along the Squamish and Cheakamus Rivers and feed on salmon spawning in the area.

/Friendship/ is a term used to denote co/operative and supportive behaviour
between two o

r more humans. This article focuses on the notion specific to
interpersonal relationships.

 In this sense, the term connotes a relationship
which involves mutual knowledge, esteem, 

and affection. Friends will welcome
each other/s company and exhibit loyalty towards each 

other, often to the point
of altruism. Their tastes will usually be similar and may conver

ge, and they
will share enjoyable activities. They will also engage in mutually helping
be

havior, such as exchange of advice and the sharing of hardship. A friend is
someone who ma

y often demonstrate reciprocating and reflective behaviors. Yet
for many, friendship is no

thing more than the trust that someone or something
will not harm them. Value that is foun

d in friendships is often the result of a
friend demonstrating on a consistent basis/
/ th

e tendency to desire what is best for the other,
/ sympathy and empathy,
/ honesty, perhap

s in situations where it may be difficult for others to speak
  the truth,
/ mutual unders

tanding.

In a comparison of personal relationships, friendship is considered to be closer


than acquaintanceship, although there is a range of degrees of intimacy in both
friendshi

ps and acquaintanceships. Friendship and acquaintanceship can be
thought of spanning acros

s the same continuum.

The principal disciplines studying friendship are sociology, anthro

pology and
zoology. Various theories of friendship have been proposed, among which are
soc

ial psychology, social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics,
and attachme

nt styles. See [[Interpersonal relationship/Theories of
interpersonal relationships/Interp

ersonal relationships]]

History of Friendship Friendship is considered one of the central

 human
experiences, and has been sanctified by all major religions. [[The Epic of
Gilgames

h]], a Babylonian poem that is among the earliest known literary works
in history, chronic

les in great depth the friendship between Gilgamesh and
Enkidu. The Greco/Roman had, as a 

paramount example, the friendship of Orestes
and Pylades. The Abrahamic faiths have the st

ory of David and Jonathan. The
Christian Gospels state that Jesus Christ declared, /No one

 has greater love
than this, to lay down one/s life for one/s friends.//John 15/13/

In ph

ilosophy, Aristotle is perhaps best known for his discussion /in the
[[Nicomachean Ethics]

]/ of [[philia]], which is usually /somewhat misleadingly/
translated as /friendship/, and

 certainly included friendship, though is a much
broader concept.

Cultural variations

A 

group of friends consists of two or more people who are in a mutually pleasing
relationshi

p engendering a sentiment of camaraderie, exclusivity and mutual
trust. There are varying 

degrees of /closeness/ between friends. Hence, some
people choose to differentiate and cat

egorize friendships based on this
sentiment.

Russia

The relationship is constructed diff

erently in different cultures. In Russia,
for example, one typically accords very few peop

le the status of /friend/. These
friendships however make up in intensity what they lack i

n number. Friends are
entitled to call each other by their first names alone, and to use d

iminutives.
A norm of polite behaviour is addressing /acquaintances/ by full first name pl

us
patronymic. These could include relationships which elsewhere would be qualified
as rea

l friendships, such as workplace relationships of long standing, neighbors
with whom one s

hares an occasional meal and visit, and so on. Physical contact
between friends is expecte

d, and friends, whether or not of the same sex, will
embrace, sometimes kiss and walk in p

ublic with their arms around each other, or
arm/in/arm, or hand/in/hand /like kids often d

o/, without the slightest
embarrassment or sexual connotation /// this is not often seen i

n the modern
Russia, and may be some highly outdated norm.

According to Oleg Kharkhordin 

in a paper on the politics of friendship, in
Soviet society, friendships were /a suspect v

alue for the Stalinist regime/ in
that they presented a stronger allegiance that could sta

nd in possible
opposition to allegiance to the Communist party. /By definition, a friend w

as an
individual who would not let you down even under direct menace to him/ or
herself/ a

 person to whom one could securely entrust one/s controversial
thoughts since he or she wo

uld never betray them, even under pressure.
Friendship thus in a sense became an ultimate 

value produced in resistance
struggles in the Soviet Union/.

Greece In Ancient Greece, in a text in defence of pederas

ty, Plato asserts/ /the
interests of rulers require that their subjects should be poor in 

spirit, and
that there should be no strong bond of friendship or society among them, which


love, above all other motives, is likely to inspire, as our Athenian tyrants
learned by e

xperience/ for the love of Aristogeiton and the constancy of
Harmodius had a strength whic

recogniza/>able as the national bird<of the United State/>s.

The< species was/>s on the brink of extirpation in th< U.S. late in th/>he twentieth
cent<ury, but now has a stable p/>population and is in the p<ocess of being removed
from />the U.S. <federal government s list of enda/>ngered species. The Bal< Eagle
was officiall/>ly reclassified from<  Endangered  to  Threatened />  on Jul< 12,/> 1995
by the< U.S. Fish   Wildli/>fe Se<r/>vic<e. On July 6, 1999, there was/> a pro<posal

This sea eagle <ets bot/>h its normal and< scientific names from th/>he distin<tive
/>appearance of the adult s head.< Bald in the English />name is deriv<ed from the
word/> [[piebald]], and refer<s to the white head and tail feathers a/>nd their
contrast with the< da/>rker body. The <scientific name is derived fr/>rom Haliaeetus<,
New Latin for  sea eagle,   from />the Ancient Greek<haliaetos  and/> leucoceph<lus,
Latinized Anci/>ient Greek for  white head , f<rom leukos   white   and kephale
  head />  .

Description and systema<ics
/>

An immature Bald Eagle has speckl<d brown plumage, the disti/>inc<ive white head
and body developing 2 3 y/>years later, before sexual< mat/>urity. This sp<ecies is
distingu/>uishable fro< the Golden Eagle in that t/>he latter has feathers< which
extend down the legs. Also, the i/>immature Bald Ea<le has more light feathers in/>n
the upper arm area, especially aroun< the  armpit .

Body length/>h ranges from 27 to 40 <inches  68 100 cm . Adult femal/>es have<an
average wingspan of/> about 7 feet<  2.1 meters   adult males have a wings/>s<an of 6
ft 6 in  2 mete/>rs .< Adult f/>females w<igh approximately 12.8 lb  5/>.8 kg , males
wei<h 9 l/>lb  4.1 kg . The smallest< specimens are those />from Florida, where an<
adul/>t male may barely exceed 5 lb  2.3 kg  a<d a wingspan of 6 feet/>t  1.8
meters . The <largest are/> the Alaskan birds, where large female<s may exceed 16.5
lb  7.5 kg  and hav/>e a wingspan of over 8 feet  2.4 <meters .

The northern b/>irds are the <subsp/>pecies washington<iensis, whereas the southern
ones bel/>long to the nominate subspecies le<cocepha/>alus. They are separated
approxima<ely at latitude /> 38   N, <or roughly the latitude of /> San Francisco 
north<rn birds reach a bit furth/>her south on the Atlantic Coast<, where they />occu<r
south to/> the <Cape Hatteras area. />Au<dubon />s type specimen of   Washington s
<Eagle     named in honor o/>f George Washington ref  As exp<licitly stated by
A/>udubon. However, the <ubspecific name he chose   wash/>ingtoniensis   means
properly  from <Washington  state  . There has />been <c/>onsiderabl< confusion, with
some autho/>or< /> changing it to washingtoni<,   George  Washingt/>on s , but the form
as ori<ginally written is cor/>rect. /ref 
  was apparently an e<ceptionally l/>large bird, such as are more often fou<d in
  Alaska  these /> have been< proposed as subs/>peci<es alascanu/>s or alascensis, but
  the variation is<clinal and fol/>llows Bergmann s Rule.

The Ba<ld Eagle forms a sp/>pecies <air with the Eurasian White tailed Eag/>le. These
diverged from other Sea Eagles< at /> the beginning o<f the/> Early Miocene  c. 10 my< /> 
at latest, possib<ly   if the most ancient fossil record/>d is correctly assigned to
this genus<  as ear/>ly as the Early/Middle Oligocen<e, some 28 mya  />Wink et al.
1996 <ef  The authors/>s  reservations about using th< generalized  2/>2   rate of
molecular e<olution have since prove/>n to be well founded. /ref  . As in<oth/>he<r
sea eagle species />pairs, this one consists of a whi<te headed/>  the Bald Eagle 
and a tan headed spe<cies. T/>They probably diverged in the North P<acific, spreading
westwards into /> Eurasia and eastwa<rds into North Amer/>rica. Like the third northern
specie<s, Steller />s Sea eagle, t<hey have yellow talon/>s, beaks and eyes in adults.

Bald E<agles are powerful fliers, and also soar/> <on thermal convection currents.

In the/> wild, Bald Eagles typical<ly live about 20 30 years, but can r/>realize a
life span of appr<ximately 50 ye/>ears. They generally <li/>ive longer in ca<tivity, up
to 60 years.

Bal/>d Eagles normally squeak and have <a shrill cry, punctuated /> by grunts. They do
no< make the  eagle scream , usual/>ly the call <f a Red tailed Ha/>awk, <hat is
sometimes dubb/>bed into films <or dramatic effect.

Range and habita/>at

The Bald Eagle s natural range co<vers most of North America, inc/>l<uding most of
Canada,/> all of the continental United< States, and northern M/>exico. The bird
it<self is able to live in most of North />America s varied habit<ats from the
bayous of Louisiana t/>o the Sonoran desert and t<h/>he eastern deciduous forests of
Quebec <nd New England. It/> can be a migratory bird but<it also is not un/>nhear< of
for /> a nesting<pair to overwint/>ter in its breeding a<ea.
/>

Bald Eagles will also co<gregate in certain locations in/> winter. From November
until<February, between/>n one and two thousand birds winter in<Squamish, British
Colu/>mbia, about halfway betw<een Vancouver and Whistler. The/>e birds primarily sit
along the Sq<amish and Cheak/>kamus Rivers and feed on salmon spawning< in the area.
