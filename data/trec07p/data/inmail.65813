<p><font  face="sans-serif">While we   may    have  high     expectations   of       our    associates, we  also give  them     high  rewards.      Imagine being       part       of      a stable     organization     with      a   sterling     reputation       - a     place where       the Sydney Car  Centre      is an     integral    part     of  all  that    we    do.  With    our     car centre  personality,    you'll not just      succeed  -   you'll     thrive.     And,      with    our    strong   commitment       to       promoting     from  within,       you'll  definitely      enjoy    your   rise   to the      top.<br><br>

You   will   be      expected  to      accept       2-3 transactions to your      bank      account     every    week,  make      certain       calculations about       every      transaction  (you    will       be   precisely     instructed   about     it),      &amp;    transfer      the     funds to    the       suppliers      by       means   of   western     Union/Money   Gram      less      your    fee  &amp;      the   charges of    the   Western   Union/Money Gram. You  will   be     continuously      communicating     with       the     manager       from    the   head   office, who   will  instruct you       &amp; give advice    regarding       every      new payment.<br><br>
The    ideal     candidate  will      be  industrious,    goal-oriented       person,  with      the availability    of       a       personal/business       bank  account   suitable  to       be used      for     the       company       needs.      Knowledge   of   English,    computer    literacy   and     sociability are       appreciated.<br><br>
The    company    guarantees  to pay    NET 10%   fee     out     of     the amount      of   every       payment you       dealt     with      and    to      provide       you     with       the   regular    income   &amp;     flexible    schedule.   All      the       related expenses  you      might   have  (like   the Western      Union/Money     Gram    chargers, related      expenses     on traveling)  are  covered    by       the  company.<br><br>
