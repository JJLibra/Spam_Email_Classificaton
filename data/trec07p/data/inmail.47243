The  University of Helsinki   ,   is a university located in Helsinki, Finland.
It is the oldest and largest university in Finland with the widest range of
disciplines available. Around 38,000 students  including 5,500 post graduate
students  are currently enrolled in the degree programs of the university.

The university is a member of the League of European Research Universities and
the Europaeum and places heavy emphasis on high quality research.

History  For the early history  1640 1809 , see the main article [[  bo Kungliga
Akademi Royal Academy of Turku]] The university was founded in 1640 by Count Per
Brahe in Turku, as the Royal Academy of Turku   . It was the third university
founded in the Swedish Empire, following Uppsala University and the Academia
Gustaviana in Dorpat, the predecessor of the University of Tartu in Estonia.

In 1809, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy in subjugation to imperial
Russia, wherefore the name of the academy in Turku was modified to be Imperial
Academy of Turku. Following the great city fire of Turku in 1827 and the move of
the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland, under Russian rule since 1809, to
Helsinki, the university was relocated there starting from 1829 and Nicholas I
re named it Imperial Alexander University of Finland in honor of his late
brother and predecessor Czar Alexander I of Russia, who had given new resources
to the academy. This university was the practical center of Finnish culture in
19th century, and a remarkable cradle of nationalist movements, liberalization
demands, political parties, collections of cultural materials, and student
activities. It was named the University of Helsinki after Finland became
independent in 1917.

The main building of the university, which was designed by Carl Ludvig Engel,
was completed in 1832. It is located next to the Senate Square in the heart of
Helsinki s neoclassical centre, facing the Cathedral and the Government s
Palace. Most of the important buildings in the City Centre Campus, such as the
University Library, the Observatory and several faculty buildings, are also
designed by Engel.

Campuses


The university is located on four main campuses. Originally, the entire
university was located in the very centre of Helsinki, but due to the rapid
growth of university since the 1930s, premises have been built and acquired in
other areas.

The historical [http //www.helsinki.fi/inbrief/City_Centre_Campus.html City
Centre Campus] has been the hub of activity ever since the university moved from
Turku to Helsinki in the early 19th Century. The campus has a central location
and reflects the architectural style of this part of the city. The university
buildings in the city center house the Faculties of Theology, Law, Arts,
Behavioural Sciences and Social Sciences plus administrative functions. Most of
the buildings on the campus have a major architectural significance.

The Kumpula Campus, housing the Faculty of Science, is located four kilometers
from the centre of Helsinki.

The [http //www.helsinki.fi/inbrief/Campus_meilahti.html Meilahti Campus], with
the Faculty of Medicine, is a part of the Meilahti Hospital District on the
outskirts of the city centre.

The [http //viikki.helsinki.fi/english/ Viikki Campus] is located in a semi 
rural area of Viikki, some 8 kilometres north east of the city centre. It houses
the Faculties of Agriculture and Forestry, Biosciences, Veterinary Medicine and
Pharmacy.

Organization The university is divided into eleven faculties. They are listed
below in the official order used by the university, reflecting both the history
of the university and the hierarchy of disciplines at the time when the
university was established

Jurassic Park/ is a techno/thriller novel written by Michael Crichton that was
published i

n 1990. Often considered a cautionary tale on unconsidered biological
tinkering in the sam

e spirit as Mary Shelley/s [[Frankenstein]], it uses the
mathematical concept of chaos the

ory and its philosophical implications to
explain the collapse of an amusement park showca

sing certain genetically
recreated dinosaur species. It was adapted into a film in 1993.



The book has one sequel, [[The Lost World /Michael Crichton//The Lost World]],
in 1993, wh

ich was also adapted into a , in 1997.

Plot summary The novel, in an /introduction/, is i

nitially presented as a brief
report on the consequences of /The InGen Incident/, which oc

curred on August
1989. This /fiction as fact/ presentation had been used by Crichton befor

e, in
[[Eaters of the Dead]] and [[The Andromeda Strain]]. Crichton frames his
chapters be

tween the /iterations/ of chaotic behavior predicted by the character
Ian Malcolm in his /

book/within/a/book/ report.

The narrative begins by slowly tying together a series of inc

idents involving
strange animal attacks in Costa Rica and on Isla Nublar, the main setting

 for
the story. After paleontologist Alan Grant and his paleobotanist graduate
student Ell

ie Sattler enter the sequence of queried experts they are abruptly
whisked off by billiona

ire John Hammond /founder and CEO of International
Genetic Technologies/ for a weekend vis

it to a /zoological preserve/ he has
established on an island 120 miles off the west coast

 of Costa Rica.

Recent events have spooked Hammond/s considerable investors and, to placa

te
them, he means for Grant and Sattler to act as fresh consultants. They stand in
counter

balance to a rock/star/like mathematician and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm
and a lawyer repr

esenting the investors, Donald Gennaro. Both are pessimistic,
but Malcolm, having been con

sulted before the park/s creation, is emphatic in
his prediction that the park will collap

se, as it is an unsustainably simple
structure bluntly forced upon a complex system.

Upon

 arrival the park is revealed to contain cloned dinosaurs, which have been
recreated from 

damaged dinosaur DNA /found in mosquitoes that sucked Saurian
blood and were then trapped 

and preserved in amber/ that have been spliced with
reptilian, avian, or amphibian DNA to 

fill in the sequence gaps. Hammond proudly
showcases InGen/s secret advances in genetic en

gineering and parades them
through the island/s vast array of automated systems.

To count

er Malcolm/s dire prognostications with youthful energy Hammond groups
the consultants wit

h his grandchildren, Tim and Alexis /Lex/ Murphy, who have
been sent on vacation while the

ir parents divorce. While touring the park with
the children, Grant finds an eggshell seem

ing to prove Malcolm/s earlier
assertion that the dinosaurs have been breeding against the

 geneticists/ design
/the population graphs proudly introduced earlier were naturally dist

ributed/.

Malcolm suggests a flaw in their method of analyzing dinosaur populations /they


did not bother to set their software to search the motion detectors for more
than the exp

ected number of creatures, only fewer/ and the park/s controllers
are reluctant to realize

 that the park has long been operating beyond their
constraints. Malcolm also points out t

he height distribution of the
Procompsognathids forms a Gaussian distribution, the curve o

f a breeding
population.

In the midst of this the chief programmer of Jurassic Park/s con

trolling
software, Dennis Nedry, attempts some corporate espionage for Lewis Dodgson, a
ge

neticist and agent of InGen/s infamous archrival, Biosyn. By activating
/trapdoors/ he wro

te into the system, Nedry manages to quickly steal 15 frozen
embryos from the laboratories

 without being detected by the island/s security
systems. He then attempts to smuggle them

 out to a contact waiting at the
auxiliary dock deep in the park /use of the main dock wou

ld be noticed/. But his
plan goes awry/ during a sudden tropical storm Nedry becomes lost 

inside the
park and crashes his stolen jeep. He is then spat upon and blinded by a
poisono

us [[Dilophosaurus]] before being eaten.

Nedry/s plan called for him to secretly deliver 

the embryos and return to the
park/s control room within fifteen minutes but, without him 

to quietly patch the
system, the park/s security is left off, leaving the electrified fenc

es
deactivated. Without the barriers to contain them, dinosaurs begin to escape. A
[[Tyran

nosaurus rex]] and a juvenile tyrannosaurus attack the people on tour,
destroying the vehi
