ERMX Jumps 12.5% and Volume Goes Through The Roof!

EntreMetrix Inc. (ERMX)
$0.18 UP 12.5%

Big news last week pushed investors to the table. Wallst.net release of
an audio interview got them excited. This is only the first day after
the release. Act fast and get on ERMX Tuesday morning!

So, what's The Great Paradox I'm talking about regarding all
thecontroversy over The Secret? , has launched dozens of web sites which
offer online shopping, free stuff, website reviews and more.

Thank you so much for the question. There's no mushrooms in the pizza!

My father was extremely verbally and emotionally abusive. He is in what
they call permenant remission. I am deeply greatfull to God that I was
able to give to Him all the justified rage and hatred of my abusers. Or
at the very least, a nice little increase.

My heart begins to race. My family prayed over my dad while he laid in
his hospital bed barely conscious. I know I would have called for the
reason that I didn't get what I had ordered and that's what I was
looking forward too.

In my own style, via my own life, via the vessel of my ownexperiences
and soul, this is what I was writing to you about, and what every other
inspirational writer . I believe I am in the awakening of a miracles and
the beautiful unconditional conscousness of love, Banditta will be full
cured.

The Universe and God awaits you. I don't want to 'win' a pizza. My son
said "Mom, let me leave you with this. Now my question to you, my friend
- What do you think happened next? It's not there either! or so they
appeared at the time.

Weather you liked the pizza or not.

Plain cheese pizza is so FABU!
As you sat there pondering what to do, it hit you. Asked for the manager
and said, "Hey, my monthly pizza arrived without mushrooms and onions
UNDER the cheese".

I worried about who would be taking care of him. "You Can" realize your
Life Vision. Certainly, the miracle of his recovery from this condition
is much bigger than the fact that probably the best doctor in the nation
was his doctor.
I look down at the pizza.

It's said that money doesn't grow on trees, right? Google will now lets
you put three link units instead of two on the same Web page.

All was successful until he got home.

And yet, at different times of our lives,we glimpse the possibility of
the magic weyearn for, and for just an instance, the skyopens up and the
light of the true Creatorsparkles in our eyes.

He is now at home and is alive and still getting better.

In the meantime, the loss of such a big advertiser is likely to drag
prices down across the network. And now -      The first bite.
Valuable content at no cost!

I take two stove-hot boxes from the bright-eyed Papa John's courier.
What a bright and new fresh day it will be when you become accountable.

Guess it right first on the blog, and in the next few days I'll share
with everyone what special bonus you win in addition to the home
delivery of pizza. A few weeks later, a widower who had been married to
one of mama's friends asked her to lunch after church. I worried about
who would be taking care of him.

I prayed for both, and the next day the drapes came - the exact size and
color to fit the window and match the carpet!
In the grander scheme of things, things like pizza, or postings, are
trivial. "That" Secret is the biggest bunch of nonsense served to the
public on a shiny platter all year. Therefore, the question is - "So
what do I do now? I found an old email with information on "Dream
Healer" by Adam. Have them say "hello", upload it, and away you go! My
brother asked me, is it working in your life? When we first found out
about his condition, we had no idea what his condition was. Stay still,
just enjoying the moment.

My family prayed over my dad while he laid in his hospital bed barely
conscious. I believe that God through the Holy Spirit touched my heart
on that particular day to pray that prayer about my mother.
I felt so compeled to do the service, and as I stood there that day I
truly knew I was a miracle in the making.

- and reframing it in such a way as to show youthe hidden gifts,
strengths and wealth to be had when looking atthese same challenges in a
different light. But it does raise a question though.

It's sitting there right in front of your eyes!
