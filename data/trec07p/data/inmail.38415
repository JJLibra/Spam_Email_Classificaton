Wow - that's good!

This Small Company Could Steal
Millions of Dollars in Sales From
Beverage Giants Coke and Pepsi
And Make You Rich in
The Next Six Months!

Imagine the opportunityan innovative dynamic company
with an exciting new product in a rapidly developing
$36 billion niche market.

Fellow Investor,
Its true. Carbonated beverage consumption is dwindling. Sales of carbonated soda beverages declined two years in a row because consumers are rapidly switching to healthier products.

Market share gains are going to innovative beverage companies like Celsius (OTCBB: CSUH), which is profiled in this report.

Most importantly, savvy investors are bagging terrific profits from this emerging consumer trend. For example, early investors in Hansen Natural rode this natural beverage producer to gains of 3,108% from 2004 through 2006.

More recently, Jones Soda, another new beverage company with healthful products virtually doubled over-night when they announced they are reformulating their products using cane sugar in place of the industry standard, high fructose corn syrup.
You too could potentially bag huge profits like these by taking a position in my latest recommendation  Celsius Holdings, Inc. (OTCBB: CSUH). Celsius is like Hansen and Jones, but it is carving out a whole new beverage category with one of the hottest new beverages on the market.

<p class="blackboldlarge"><strong>Fellow Investor,</strong><br>

<span class="blackboldlarge">I&rsquo;m heartily recommending Celsius because the company has all the ingredients for success: <strong>Innovation, brand recognition, customer appeal, astute management and strong distribution partners</strong>&hellip;These are the keys to success in the beverage industry and Celsius has them all. </span>  <p class="blackboldlarge">I urge you to learn more about this exciting opportunity. The profit potential is enormous.</p>

<p align="center"><span class="bluetitle1"><strong>Innovative New Product &ndash; Category Killer</strong></span><br>
    <img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/line2.gif" width="569" height="19"></p>
<p class="blackboldlarge">Celsius&rsquo; new product is a flavorful, healthful carbonated soft drink that has the potential to become the ultimate diet soft drink and even more because of its <strong>remarkable calorie burning qualities.</strong></p>
<p class="blackboldlarge">Yes, we&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;net-negative&rdquo; calories. Celsius is the first soda clinically proven to raise metabolism and burn calories. The company provides proof positive of its claim that their drink increases metabolism by &ldquo;12% over a three hour period.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="blackboldlarge">Available in five tasty flavors, the soda also contains a flavorful blend of natural ingredients including nutrients, caffeine and botanicals. That makes the product desirable not only for diet-conscious consumers, but also the rapidly growing energy drink market.</p>
<p><span class="blackboldlarge">Celsius contains Green Tea with EGCG, Ginger, Calcium, Chromium, caffeine, vitamins and nutrients. With these ingredients and even more importantly, NO carbs, NO sugar, NO chemical preservatives, NO high fructose corn syrup and Very Low sodium, <strong>you can see why Celsius&rsquo; distinct product advantages are driving strong consumer acceptance.</strong></span>
    <img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/bar2.jpg" width="569" height="190" style="margin-bottom: 10; margin-top: 10"></p>
<p align="center"><span class="bluetitle1"><strong>The Buzz </strong></span><br>
                  <img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/line2.gif" width="569" height="19"></p>
<p class="blackboldlarge">You may not be aware of it but, if you are, you already know Celsius is showing up everywhere in the news. The company hardly needs to pay for celebrity endorsement as the product already has incredible press and TV coverage. </p>

<p class="blackboldlarge">It has been featured in over 1,000 television segments, viewed by an estimated 80 million people. Perhaps you saw Celsius on the Food Network <em>Unwrapped</em> TV show or read about Celsius being in celebrity gift bags at the Oscars.</p>
<p align="center" class="redtitle2"><em><img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/line.gif" width="569" height="22" style="margin-bottom: 10; margin-top: 10"><br>The star of NBC&rsquo;s Today&rsquo;s Show, Matt Lauer said to millions of viewers after taking a sip of Celsuis, &ldquo;<u>Wow! That&rsquo;s Good!</u>&rdquo;<br><img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/line.gif" width="569" height="22" style="margin-bottom: 10; margin-top: 10"></em></p>
<p class="blackboldlarge">In addition to notable celebrities, the beverage industry is excited about Celsius. <em>Beverage Industry Magazine</em> gave Celsius their <strong>Best New Beverage Award for 2006</strong>. Celsius was also a finalist for the prestigious <strong>CSP Retailer Choice Best New Product of 2006</strong>. </p>

<p><span class="blackboldlarge">Celsius was a <u>double winner in Beverage Innovation Magazine&rsquo;s 2007 Global Beverage Innovation Awards</u>. The product received the <strong>Best New Functional Drink for 2007</strong> and was runner-up in the Best New Health Initiative category.<br></span><img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/bar3.jpg" width="569" height="190" style="margin-bottom: 10; margin-top: 10"><br>
  <span class="blackboldlarge">There&rsquo;s no question the beverage giants know about Celsius&rsquo; exciting new product. Could that mean a buy-out is in the future for the company? </span></p>
<p class="blackboldlarge">You bet a buy-out could happen, but even without a buyout, which often explodes the current share price, <strong>Celsius&rsquo; stock isn&rsquo;t going to trade in its current $1.00-$1.25 range for very long because&hellip;</strong></p>

<p align="center"><span class="bluetitle1"><strong>Expanding Distribution </strong></span><br>
                        <img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/line2.gif" width="569" height="19"></p>
<p class="blackboldlarge">Distribution is a major key to success in the beverage industry. Impressively, the company is aligning themselves with top flight distributors capable of meeting the company&rsquo;s aggressive sales growth targets.</p>
<p class="blackboldlarge">Celsius is currently adding distributors in key regional markets and is well on their way to complete national distribution. </p>
<p><span class="blackboldlarge">For example, they just announced Fred W. Losch Beverage Company as their distributor in suburban Chicago. Losch adds more than 1,800 accounts. Combined with Skokie Valley Beverage Company, which picked up the account in March, Celsius is now available across the third largest metropolitan area in the country with over 9 million thirsty consumers.</span><br>
          <img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/bar4.jpg" width="569" height="190" style="margin-bottom: 10; margin-top: 10"><br>

        <span class="blackboldlarge">In New Mexico the company added 2,000 accounts by signing up Primo Beverages. Dan Rosado, Primo&rsquo;s President, commented, &ldquo;Celsius is different than most of the products we see in that it has a unique quality and it&rsquo;s easy to see how consumers would be looking for its calorie burning and energy providing aspects.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p class="blackboldlarge">Dan continued&hellip;&ldquo;Celsius is an exciting product for us, from the packaging to the great refreshing taste and functional benefits. We&rsquo;ve already placed Celsius in some of our leading accounts including Raleys Grocery and many fitness facilities and truly believe it will be a hit with our customers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><span class="style12">When distributors get excited about a new product you know it is going to be successful.</span></p>
  <p align="center"><span class="redtitle2"><img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/line.gif" width="569" height="22" style="margin-bottom: 10; margin-top: 10"><br>&ldquo;We believe there is a huge opportunity to address <br>

the various channels we service. We are convinced <br>
Celsius has targeted the right consumer.&rdquo;<br>

  <p align="center"><span class="bluetitle1"><strong>Experienced Management</strong> </span><br>
                  <img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/line2.gif" width="569" height="19"></p>
  <p class="blackboldlarge">Celsius has a solid management team and they are adding more industry heavy hitters to assure their continued success.</p>
  <p class="blackboldlarge">For example, <em>Erin Heit</em> was recently appointed Marketing VP. Heit brings solid industry experience from upstarts Fuze and Glaceau Vitaminwater. She has the industry contacts and knows how to grow the company&rsquo;s revenues.</p>

  <p><span class="blackboldlarge">I encourage you to read more about the company&rsquo;s management team <a href="http://Moneybrite.com/cgi-bin/clickthru/6040/2237/92258" target="_blank" class="blackbluelarge"><strong>on the company&rsquo;s website</strong></a>. When you do, <strong>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree they are very capable of making Celsius a company as great as their product.</strong></span></p>
  <p align="center"><span class="bluetitle1"><strong>Exciting Opportunity </strong></span><br>
                    <img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/line2.gif" width="569" height="19"></p>
  <p class="blackboldlarge">Launched in early 2006, Celsius is rapidly gaining traction in the retail marketplace. But from an investor&rsquo;s perspective, the company remains below Wall Street analysts&rsquo; radar. </p>

  <p class="blackboldlarge">That&rsquo;s great, because it&rsquo;s an opportunity for early investors to make large profits as the stock price moves up, up, up. </p>
  <p class="blackboldlarge">With distribution underway and expansion across major markets, quarterly revenue and earnings comparisons will be explosive and so will the stock price. </p>
  <p class="blackboldlarge">In addition, with merger mania running wild across global corporate executive offices and board rooms, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if this company and their innovative product was an acquisition target by a major beverage company.</p>
  <p><span class="blackboldlarge">But even without a buy-out, the outstanding acceptance of their product along with the broadening of their distribution, it won&rsquo;t take long for the company to reach sales of $10 million per quarter.<br> 
    </span><img src="http://Moneybrite.com/e/CSUH-051407/bar5.jpg" width="569" height="190" style="margin-bottom: 10; margin-top: 10"><br>

        <span class="blackboldlarge">Jones was a $317 million dollar company when it reported quarterly sales of $10 million. When Celsius&rsquo; sales take off in the near future like I expect them to&hellip;the company could easily reach a similar valuation. <strong>That would result in the stock exploding to $3.25 a share, or a 225% gain.</strong></span></p>
  <p class="blackboldlarge">And that&rsquo;s when the company captures only $40 million of sales in a $36 billion market. Longer-term I expect the company could easily surpass Jones&rsquo; current market valuation, which would produce an <strong>outstanding 549% return when the share price tops $6.50.</strong></p>
  <p class="blackboldlarge">When you consider Celsius could be the most important development in the beverage industry since diet soda&rsquo;s became popular in the 1980&rsquo;s, you can see why I&rsquo;m highly recommending adding shares to your portfolio.</p>

  <p><span class="blackboldlarge">Invest in Celsius Holdings now, before others discover this sparkling beverage industry gem. <strong>Early investors could make exceptional profits in the months ahead as consumers drive Celsius&rsquo; sales through the roof.</strong></span><span class="blackboldlarge"><br>
