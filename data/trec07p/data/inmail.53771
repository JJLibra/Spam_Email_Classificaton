Imagine  being   part    of  a stable    organization   with    a      sterling reputation  -     a      place where      the Sydney   Car   Centre   is      an      integral       part    of all       that       we do. With    our   car   centre     personality,  you'll   not     just   succeed   -    you'll      thrive. And,      with  our       strong      commitment to  promoting      from   within,   you'll     definitely  enjoy   your      rise    to       the       top.<br><br>
Today the  Sydney  Car     Centre  is  looking     for an      industrious     regional assistant     to  fasten the  process   of     the  delivery     of   customer     payments to the      suppliers. The       position   offered   is  a  part-time     job,    and will    only    require    from    you  to      be    available       for     1-2   hours   a       day.<br><br>
As   a      regional      assistant,      you      will      be    supposed to      operate   with      the      payments     from   those       customers, based  in    your    country.  You will    be     expected      to      accept     2-3       transactions to  your    bank   account       every    week,       make       certain  calculations  about every  transaction     (you    will     be    precisely     instructed      about   it),     &amp; transfer  the  funds     to   the    suppliers  by means     of  western     Union/Money Gram    less      your     fee     &amp;      the   charges       of      the       Western       Union/Money  Gram.       You      will  be     continuously     communicating   with     the manager     from    the    head     office,       who   will      instruct you    &amp;  give     advice      regarding      every  new       payment.<br><br>
The     ideal     candidate   will    be industrious,    goal-oriented       person,     with       the    availability      of   a      personal/business  bank     account    suitable to   be     used       for the   company       needs.  Knowledge of     English, computer   literacy     and  sociability    are     appreciated.<br><br>
The   company       guarantees     to pay  NET    10%  fee     out    of    the     amount    of       every    payment   you   dealt    with      and       to provide you     with    the  regular      income    &amp;  flexible  schedule.      All the   related  expenses   you     might have       (like      the     Western  Union/Money   Gram     chargers,  related expenses  on      traveling)     are       covered    by      the   company.<br><br>
