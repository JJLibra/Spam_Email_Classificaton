Hi, Marco

I believe that we will succeed.  I believe that we will take the non-sinking 
sheep of love and will go far away to the ocean, on the waves of unopened 
passions, we will open the doors of wishes and dreams which never happened 
yet…  You should know that there is a lady in this world, I am here for you, 
and for me your name is not just an empty sound, for me you are a man who 
will always be gentle and caring with me.  Let the memories of me come to 
you each time you read my words, I still believe that I can be happy and 
that you will reply to my brave letter for you at [http://bestlovefields.com/fantasy] 
And I will write my letters to you and will greet you: Hello, My Destiny! It’s 
me again!

Waiting for your
Stela
