   The  trout cod , Maccullochella macquariensis, is a large and striking
predatory freshwater fish of the [[Maccullochella]] genus and the Percichthyidae
family which was originally found in the south east corner of the Murray Darling
river system in Australia. It is closely related to the Murray cod.

In the 1800s and early 1900s, when trout cod were widely recognised as a
separate species, they were generally known as blue nose cod or simply blue 
nose, particularly in Victoria. In some parts of New South Wales however they
were also known as trout cod, and this common name was adopted when the species
status of the fish was finally confirmed by genetic studies in the early 1970s.
This choice of official common name was perhaps unfortunate  it has been
suggested that blue nose cod is a more appropriate name as the name trout cod
causes confusion amongst the Australian public.  Trout cod are an Australian
native freshwater fish  they  are not  a hybrid between Murray cod and
introduced trout species. 

Trout cod are a listed species on a number of different registers including
Endangered under the New South Wales Fisheries Management Act 1994, the
Australian Commonwealth   s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation
Act 1999, the Australian Capital Territory s Nature Conservation Act 1980 and by
the World Conservation Union  IUCN . They are also listed as Threatened under
the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1998.

Description

Trout cod have been reliably recorded to at least 80 cm and 16 kg, but there are
some credible anecdotal accounts of larger specimens.

Trout cod are broadly similar to the Murray cod, however there are some distinct
differences in morphology and colouration.

Trout cod are a small to medium groper like fish with a deep, elongated body
that is round in cross section. In contrast to Murray cod, trout cod have a
pointed head with the top jaw overhanging the bottom jaw, and the slope of the
head is straight. The eyes are slightly larger and more prominent than in Murray
cod. The head tends to be free of speckling however a distinct dark stripe
through the eye is usually present.

Trout cod are cream to light grey on their ventral     belly     surfaces. Their
back and flanks are most commonly bluish grey in colour, overlain with irregular
black speckling, but this can be highly variable depending on the habitat
specimens come from, and can range from almost white to light grey green, light
brown, dark brown or almost black. The black speckling on the back and flanks is
consistent however.

The spiny dorsal fin is moderate in height and is partially separated by a notch
from the high, rounded soft dorsal fin. Soft dorsal, anal and caudal  tail  fins
are all large and rounded, and are light grey to dark grey or black with
distinct white edges. The large, rounded pectoral fins are usually similar in
colour to flanks. The pelvic fins are large and angular and set forward of the
pectoral fins. The leading white coloured rays on the pelvic fins split into two
trailing white filaments, while the pelvic fins themselves are usually a
translucent cream or light grey.

Smaller trout cod tend to be more slender than equivalent sized Murray cod 
curiously, very large trout cod appear to develop deeper shoulders than
equivalent sized Murray cod.

While trout cod were only conclusively described as a separate species to Murray
cod in 1972, commercial and recreational fishermen and early fishery biologists
were in no doubt that there were two separate species of cod in the Murray 
Darling system from the 1850s onwards, and noted the trout cod s different
appearance and spawning biology and preference for cooler, faster flowing water
and upland habitats. During the 1800s and early 1900s trout cod were recognised
by the scientific community as separate species, due to differing habitat
preferences, morphological differences  especially the much smaller size at
sexual maturity  and differing spawning times. It was really only post World War
II     by which time trout cod had become very rare or even extinct in much of
their original range     that the erroneous idea that they were really just
anomalous Murray cod gained any currency.

Habitat

Although there is/was a very substantial overlap in range, trout cod are
essentially a more specialised upland sister species to Murray cod. Therefore,
the trout cod s main habitats were the larger upland rivers and creeks, which
they usually co inhabited with Macquarie perch and one or both of the blackfish
species. Historical research is confirming a primarily upland distribution for
trout cod  recent governmental literature lacking such historical research and
suggesting trout cod are primarily a lowland fish species  must  be considered
inaccurate.

Division into specialist upland and primarily lowland species is a relatively
common phenomena in native fish genera of the Murray Darling and East Coast
systems with other notable pairs are show</STYLE>

r/ //

/Charadriiformes/ is a diverse order of small to medium/large birds. It includes
ab

out 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most
Charadriiformes live near 

water and eat invertebrates or other small animals/
however, some are pelagic /sea birds/,

 some occupy deserts and a few are found
in thick forest.

Systematics The order was forme

rly divided into three suborders/

/ The /[[wader]]s/ /or /Charadrii/// typical shorebirds

, most of which feed by
  probing in the mud or picking items off the surface in both coas

tal and
  freshwater environments.
/ The /[[gull]]s/ and their allies /or /Lari/// these a

re generally larger
  species which take fish from the sea. Several gulls and skuas will a

lso take
  food items from beaches, or rob smaller species, and some have become adapted
 

 to inland environments.
/ The /[[auk]]s/ /or /Alcae// are coastal species which nest on s

ea cliffs and
  /fly/ underwater to catch fish.

The Sibley/Ahlquist taxonomy, which has b

een widely accepted in America, lumps
all the Charadriiformes together with the seabirds a

nd birds of prey into a
greatly enlarged order Ciconiiformes. However, the resolution of t

he DNA/DNA
hybridization technique used by Sibley / Ahlquist was not sufficient to properl

y
resolve the relationships in this group, and indeed it appears as if the
Charadriiformes

 consititute a single large and very distinctive lineage of
modern birds of their own /Fai

n / Houde 2004/.//// morphological refs should be
locatable via family books etc ///

The 

auks, usually considered distinct because of their peculiar morphology, are
more likely re

lated to gulls, the /distinctness/ being a result of adaptation
for diving. Following rece

nt research /Ericson et al., 2003/ Paton et al., 2003/
Thomas et al., 2004a, b/ van Tuinen

 et al., 2004/ Paton / Baker, 2006/, a better
arrangement may be as follows/

  Ibisbill // Family Recurvir

ostridae/ avocets and stilts // Family
  Haematopodidae/ oystercatchers // Family Charadri

idae/ plovers and lapwings

More conservatively, the Thinocori could be included in the Sc

olopaci, and the
Chionidi in the Charadrii, or the Glareolidae could be placed in a tribe 

of
their own. The buttonquails are of indeterminate, quite basal position in the
Lari/Scol

opaci sensu lato group. The arrangement as presented here is basically
the consensus of th

e recent studies /see van Tuinen et al., 2004/ Paton / Baker,
2006/.

Evolution That the C

haradriiformes are an ancient group is also borne out by the
fossil record. Much of the Ne

ornithes/ fossil record around the K/Pg extinction
event is made up of bits and pieces of 

birds which resemble this order. In many,
this is probably due to convergent evolution bro

ught about by semi/aquatic
habits. Specimen VI 9901 /L//pez de Bertodano Formation, Late C

retaceous of Vega
Island, Antarctica/ is probably a basal charadriiform somewhat reminisce

nt of a
thick/knee. However, more complete remains of undisputed charadriiforms are
known 

only from the mid/Paleogene onwards. Present/day orders emerged around the
Eocene/Oligocen

e boundary, roughly 35/30 mya. Basal or unresolved charadriiforms

   The  trout cod , Maccullochella m/>macquariensis, is a large and stri<king

na<tive freshwater fish  they  are />not  a hybrid between Murray <cod and
intr/>roduced trout species. <
Trout cod are a l/>listed species on a number of< different registers in/>cluding
Endangered under the <ew S/>outh Wales Fisheries Management Act 1994<, the/>
Australian Commonwealt<h   s Environment Protection and Biodi/>vers<ty Con/>nservation

Descript<on

Trout cod have been reliably /> recorded to at least 80 cm and 16 kg, <ut there are
some credible an/>nec<dotal accounts of larger specimens.

Tr/>out cod are broadly simila<r to the Murray cod, however there a/>re some distinct
diffe<rences in morphology and colou/>uration.

Trout<cod are a small to medium groper/>r like <ish with a deep, elongated bod/>y
that is round in cross <ection. In contrast to Murray /> cod, <t/>trout cod have a
pointed head with the <op jaw ove/>e<hanging the bot/>ttom jaw, and the <lope of t/>the
head is straight. The eyes are sli<htly larger and more /> prominen<t t/>han in Murray
cod. The head tends to <e fre/>ee of speckling however a <distinct d/>ark stripe
through th<e eye />is usua<ly p/>present.

Trout cod <re cream to light gre/>ey on their ventral  <  /> belly <   surfaces. Their
back an/>nd flanks are <ost commonly bluish grey in co/>olour, overlain wit< i/>irregular
black speckling, but<this can be highly /> variable depending<on the habitat
/>
specimens come from, and can<range from almost white /> to ligh< grey green, light
br/>rown, dark brown or al<ost black. T/>The black speckl<ng on the back and flank/>ks is
consis<tent however.

The spiny dorsal fi/>n is m<derate in height and is partia/>ally separated by a notch
from the<high, rounded soft dorsal /> fi<. Soft dorsal/>, anal and caudal  tail < fins
are all large and rounded, an/>nd are light grey to dark grey <or black with
distinct white e/>edges. The large, rounded pectoral fins<are usually similar in
colour t/>to flanks. The pelv<ic fins are large and angular an/>d set forward of the
pectoral fins. <he leading white coloured rays />on the pelvic fins split into two
tr<ailing white filaments, while the pelvi/>c fins themsel<es are usually a
translucent cream or /> light grey.

Smal<er trout cod tend to be more slender tha/>an equivalent sized Murray c<od 
curiously, ver/>y large tr<out cod appear to d/>develop deeper <houlders than
equivalent sized Murray />cod.

While trout co<d were only conclusively des/>cribed as a separate species <o Murray
cod in 1972, commercial /> and recre<ational fishermen and early fishery /> biologists
we<e in/>n no doubt<t/>that there were<two separate speci/>es of cod in the Mu<rray 
Darling system from/> the 1850s onwards<, and noted the trout cod s different
/>appe<arance/>e and spawning bi<logy and preference/> for cooler, faster flowing wa<ter
and/> <upland habitats. During the 180/>0s and early 1900s trout cod were re<cognised
by the />s<cientific community as separate s/>species, due to differing habit<t
preferences, morphological d/>differ<nces  especially the much smaller si/>ze at
sex<ual maturity  and/> differing spawning times. It was real<ly/>y only p<st Wor/>rld War
II     by wh<ich time trout cod had become ve/>ery <are or even extinct in much of
t/>their original range   < that the erro/>neous idea that they were <really just/>t
anoma<lous Murray cod gained any currency.

/>
Habitat

Although there is/wa< a/>a very sub<tantial overlap in rang/>ge, tr<ut cod are
essentially a more specialise/>ed upland sister s<pecies to Murray co/>od. Therefore,
the trout c<d s main habitats were/>e <t/>the larger upland rivers and<creeks, which
they us/>sually co inhabited wit< Macq/>uarie perch and one or both of the bl<ackfish
species. Historical research />is <confirming a pri/>imarily upland distribution for
trou< cod  /> recent governmental literature l<acking such histori/>cal research and
suggesting trout cod <re primarily a/>a lowland fish specie<s  must  be considere/>d
inaccurate.
