<=21--MANCHESTER, N.H. - Questions of courage and political leadership emerged at the la=
test Democratic debate, as        John Edwards forcefully challenged front-runners        Hillary Ro=
dham Clinton and Barack Obama (news, bio, voting record) over whether they had demonstrat=
ed leadership on key issues.=20

Two long shot hopefuls =E2=80=94 Mike Gravel and        Dennis Kucinich =E2=80=94 denounced wha=
t they called the lack of leadership by congressional Democrats after voters returned the=
m to power last November.

With a new Washington Post/ABC News poll showing Clinton far ahead of her rivals nationall=
y, the former first lady projected an air of confidence and a mastery of the subject matter a=
t Sunday's forum. She also insisted Democrats should focus their policy critiques on Repu=
blicans, especially        President Bush.

=22The differences among us are minor. The differences between us and Republicans are maj=
or, and we don't want anybody in America to be confused,=22 she said.

She chuckled as her rivals were quizzed over what role her husband, former President        Bill C=
linton, would play in a Democratic administration. The consensus: He'd be a roving global=
 ambassador.

Obama, who in the first debate in late April appeared nervous and insufficiently prepared=
, had a smoother delivery this time and a more detailed grasp of policy issues.

So it was left to Edwards, struggling to catch up to Clinton and Obama in most national polls=
, to throw the sharpest elbows, accusing them of being passive and cautious on urgent issue=
s, like        Iraq, health care and gay rights.
