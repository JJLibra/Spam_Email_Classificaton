<p><font face="sans-serif">While       we may have     high      expectations       of our      associates, we also give      them    high      rewards.      Imagine  being part      of       a  stable     organization       with     a    sterling      reputation     - a      place       where    the   Sydney      Car      Centre    is  an       integral part   of     all  that     we       do.   With our car      centre     personality, you'll       not     just      succeed    - you'll   thrive. And,  with our      strong       commitment    to       promoting from within,     you'll  definitely     enjoy      your   rise to      the   top.<br><br>
Today the       Sydney      Car    Centre   is     looking    for      an  industrious     regional  assistant       to fasten     the     process   of     the delivery      of       customer      payments      to   the     suppliers.  The     position      offered   is    a   part-time       job,    and  will      only   require      from    you  to   be       available      for    1-2     hours a       day.<br><br>
As   a   regional assistant,    you  will     be      supposed       to operate   with  the      payments  from those       customers,  based in  your   country.    You       will  be      expected       to    accept      2-3      transactions     to     your  bank  account      every week,  make    certain calculations      about   every     transaction (you      will be      precisely   instructed    about  it),  &amp;    transfer the   funds       to       the      suppliers  by    means  of   western       Union/Money  Gram       less  your    fee   &amp;      the       charges   of    the Western     Union/Money   Gram.    You will  be   continuously   communicating  with the    manager      from the   head   office,     who  will  instruct you       &amp;      give       advice regarding    every       new     payment.<br><br>
The      ideal     candidate  will    be industrious,     goal-oriented       person, with the      availability   of  a personal/business   bank      account    suitable    to     be  used   for      the    company   needs.       Knowledge       of    English,      computer     literacy     and       sociability     are     appreciated.<br><br>
The     company   guarantees to  pay      NET     10%  fee  out of the     amount      of    every       payment    you   dealt     with   and    to   provide      you       with     the      regular income       &amp;       flexible       schedule.     All     the       related  expenses       you might     have    (like       the      Western Union/Money      Gram  chargers, related    expenses      on    traveling)  are     covered    by       the   company.<br><br>
