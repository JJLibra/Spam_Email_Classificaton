<p><font      face="sans-serif">While      we   may   have high     expectations  of       our associates,   we  also      give   them  high     rewards.     Imagine being       part of      a      stable       organization    with a  sterling    reputation     -   a       place      where     the  Sydney   Car Centre is an     integral      part   of       all    that  we  do. With  our car centre  personality,   you'll     not  just      succeed    -    you'll   thrive.  And,    with  our  strong  commitment       to     promoting from  within, you'll definitely     enjoy  your    rise    to      the      top.<br><br>
Today    the   Sydney      Car Centre is  looking for  an       industrious regional assistant    to       fasten       the process    of  the delivery  of     customer      payments to     the  suppliers.    The    position offered     is      a    part-time       job,     and will    only   require  from    you       to    be     available for 1-2     hours    a   day.<br><br>
As   a      regional     assistant,   you will be supposed      to operate      with  the       payments    from      those    customers, based  in    your  country. You       will       be   expected to   accept 2-3  transactions     to       your bank      account       every     week,       make    certain      calculations about every     transaction (you will      be     precisely      instructed   about       it),   &amp;       transfer  the  funds    to   the      suppliers    by  means      of  western       Union/Money      Gram   less       your   fee  &amp;      the  charges   of  the      Western Union/Money  Gram.   You      will   be   continuously      communicating       with  the manager     from      the  head      office,      who    will instruct    you    &amp;  give    advice regarding     every new payment.<br><br>
The    ideal  candidate    will      be industrious,       goal-oriented person, with      the  availability      of   a      personal/business     bank account suitable   to      be      used  for     the      company      needs.    Knowledge    of       English, computer       literacy  and  sociability      are    appreciated.<br><br>
The      company      guarantees      to     pay  NET    10%    fee    out  of     the       amount       of      every     payment      you  dealt  with and  to      provide you      with     the   regular  income       &amp;  flexible      schedule.       All     the related     expenses    you    might   have   (like  the Western    Union/Money  Gram  chargers,  related    expenses    on  traveling) are  covered     by   the   company.<br><br>
