        Dear Reader,

        Our featured company today, Dhanoa Minerals Ltd.
        (OTCBB: DHNA), is a newly incorporated natural resource
        exploration company. It is acquiring, exploring and
        developing existing and new natural resource properties
        thought to contain significant quantities of gold and
        other minerals.

        When evaluating small cap gold companies, indications
        of revenue are among the most important insight an
        investor can receive.  These extraction estimates are
        about as close to a crystal ball as it gets in the
        junior mining arena.  To this end, recent news from
        Dhanoa Minerals seems to be a positive signal to its
        investors.  Dhanoa announced that it has completed a
        resource extraction estimate for its three mines in the
        Bella Rica region of southern Ecuador.  First year
        production (ending in June, 2008) is expected to be
        approximately 100,000 ounces of gold, generating
        revenues upwards of $68 million, with gold at $680 per
        ounce.  By the end of year two, production is projected
        to reach 250,000 ounces of gold per year. If these
        levels are reached, revenues could rise to $170 million
        within 24 months.
                               -----------

             Dhanoa Minerals Ltd. (DHNA) has been rated
             “Outperform” with a target price of $4.30 by
             Beacon Equity Research

               A comprehensive research report focusing on
              Dhanoa Minerals and the gold mining industry
              has been published by Beacon Equity Research
                   and is available free of charge to
                    StockUpTicks readers. (See Below)

                The Full Report on Dhanoa Minerals Ltd.
              From Beacon Equity Research is available HERE

        In the report, the analyst writes, “Dhanoa owns a 100%
        interest in two adjacent mineral projects in Canada -
        Close-Allies I and Close Allies II.  In addition,
        Dhanoa holds an 80% interest in an Ecuador mining
        company, Promenasa.  The Company also recently acquired
        four properties that are part of the Bonanza Project in
        the Bellarica gold mining camp in Ecuador.  These are
        gold producing mines and Dhanoa plans to significantly
        increase production by upgrading extrac­tion
        operations.”  "Dhanoa anticipates production at the end
        of its first year (ending June 2008) to be
        approximately 100,000 ounces of gold. At recent gold
        prices, the value of 2008 production would result in
        approximately $68 million.”

                                 [Image]

             Dhanoa is a production stage company formed
             for the purpose of acquiring, exploring, and
             developing natural resource properties.
             Activities during the production and
             exploration stage include further development
             of the Company's business plan and raising
             capital. The Company has recently initiated a
             new program to evaluate undervalued assets
             for potential addition to its mineral claim
             portfolio.

                       Dhanoa’s Current Operations

        Dhanoa’s Bella Rica project consists of three mines in
        Southwest Ecuador, with a current production cost of
        $280.00 per ounce. These mines currently operate at a
        cost of $280.00 per ounce and are producing enough to
        reach 100,000 ounces of high grade gold in 2007. With
        gold at $680.00 per ounce, this equates to $40 million
        dollars in revenue for Dhanoa.

                     Dhanoa’s Property Study Results

        Dhanoa’s Bonanza properties were most recently part of
        a study performed by independent geologist Larry
        Sostad, an expert in geophysics, mining exploration,
        geology, and geochemistry. The random samples were
        taken using the various tunnels at the company's three
        gold producing mines in southern Ecuador and then sent
        to an Assayers laboratory in Canada where they were
        certified. Of these, the following three were the most
        encouraging:

        A2709-2 238.20 Au g/tonne

        A2712-1 24.50 Au g/tonne 300.30 Ag g/tonne

        A2712 78.20 Au g/tonne 144.00 Ag g/tonne

        The industry standard is approximately 20 g/ton.
        Reserve estimates, resource samples and estimates are
        not Ni 43-101 certified.

                                 Ecuador

        Southern Ecuador has rapidly become an attractive
        choice for mineral exploration/development companies.
        Permissive geology in unexplored or under explored
        areas, a stable mining code, an opportunistic labor
        pool, no restrictions on capital flows, and relatively
        good infrastructure has led to the recent interest in
        the country.

        Compounding the new exploration interest in Ecuador is
        a series of discovery/ development projects that have
        potential to be world class. The most recent find is
        Aurelian’s Fruta Del Norte epithermal gold discovery in
        southeastern Ecuador. With less than 20 drill holes in
        the discovery area ARU market cap is already at C$600
        million.

        This suggests that the market believes ARU is on to a
        5-6 million oz target (using US$100/oz Au). Corriente’s
        Mirador Cu-Au project is 14km north of Aurelian’s new
        discovery and based on current development plans could
        be operating by 2008, and within 18 months of start up
        producing about 250 million lbs of Cu/yr. In south
        central Ecuador, IAMGOLD is developing its Quimsacocha
        high sulphidation Au project.  The company has outlined
        thus far a 2.8 million ounce gold resource. The
        resource is open as evidenced by step out drilling
        along strike and we expect an updated resource
        calculation this fall. Preliminary mine plans suggest
        that an open pit operation could produce about 230,000
        ounces of Au per year.

                               Mining Law

        There are internal and international pressures for
        Ecuador to reduce its reliance on agriculture and oil.
        In August 2000, Ecuador revised its mining law to make
        it more attractive for foreign investment including the
        ability for foreigners to own 100% interest in mining
        properties. In 2002, government royalties on mining
        were eliminated. The current tax rate in Ecuador is
        25%.

        The right to explore for and exploit minerals is
        granted via way of mining concessions that are valid
        for 30 years and renewable. Concessions have exclusive
        rights and are defensible against third parties.
        Concessions are up to a maximum size of 5,000 hectares
        each, but there is no limit on the number of
        concessions held. Annual concession fees are payable
        with fees ranging from US$1.00 per hectare up to
        US$16.00 per hectare starting in year 13 of holding the
        title.

        Upon a production decision the operator submits an
        Initial Declaration of Production (IDP) together with
        an Environmental Impact Study (EIS). The EIS must be
        approved by the Ministry of the Environment. Surface
        rights are independent of mineral rights.

                        General Geology

            Ecuador can be divided into five north
            – south trending physiographic regions
            that extend north and south
            respectively into Columbia and Peru.
            The main metallogenic regions of
            interest include: the Western
            Cordillera (accreted Cretaceous to
            Eocene volcanics and intrusive rocks),
            and the Eastern Cordillera (includes
            Mesozoic intrusives) that occur in
            central and eastern Ecuador. Regional
            north trending basement structures are
            important controls on Tertiary
            volcanism in the Western Cordillera,
            and thus emplacement of porphyry,
            skarn and epithermal styles of
            mineralization. In the Eastern          [Image]
            Cordillera, Corriente Resources is
            targeting Cu porphyry mineralization
            in older Jurassic intrusive rocks.
            Aurelian Resources has discovered
            epithermal Au mineralization within
            the same belt of Jurassic rocks as
            those being explored by Corriente. In
            addition, epithermal gold associated
            with skarn hosts exist in the same
            eastern belt; the Nambija prospect is
            believed to have been one of the most
            prolific Spanish mining operations in
            the sixteenth century. The most
            easterly physiographic region, the
            Oriente, is host to Mesozoic sediments
            which contain most of the hydrocarbon
            reserves in Ecuador.

             Growth Strategy

             Dhanoa Minerals LTD is on schedule to
             complete its acquisition of an 80% interest
             in three gold mining operations in Southern
             Ecuador, referred to as the Bella Rica
             project. The Guanache Mine is the lowest in
             elevation, the Mollopongo Mine is at the top
             of the mountain, while the Bonanza Mine is in
             between. The vertical extent is a little more
             than 1000 feet, and the continuity of the
             gold vein systems run horizontal as well as
             vertical. It has become very clear that
             Dhanoa has established itself on favorable
             ground for extraordinary expansion and
             development.

             Part of Dhanoa’s growth strategy is to
             undertake underground expansion, open pit
             development, and creating a centralized
             modern treatment plant for the production of
             gold and silver. Dhanoa anticipates the
             Bonanza mine to reach a rate of 100,000
             ounces of gold through the next 12 months and
             then building to 300,000 ounces annually, as
             indicated by increasing production levels
             already being achieved. The goal is to
             produce 12 gr. per ton average in high grade
             gold.

             Dhanoa wants to continue to pursue new
             exploration interests using revenues
             (projected at $ 40 MM for 2007) for
             acquisitions and facility upgrades or
             installations. All the properties, and most
             formidably the Bonanza mine, are also located
             in an area where Dhanoa is strategically
             positioned within an emerging gold
             arena of international stature.

             They are actively employing state-of-the-art
             concepts for production and security. In
             mines such as these, where grades are high
             and the gold grains are visible, losses may
             exceed 15%. By the end of June, they will be
             installing cameras for 24X7 monitoring of
             their gold processing. Their intent is to
             make the live camera feed available on-line
             through their website as a means of providing
             security and enabling shareholders to view
             the extent of the operations up close.

        Dhanoa’s Modernization of Operations

        It’s expected that modernization will cost about $5
        million and be complete by the end of 2007. This
        upgrade process is expected to increase production by
        3x, meaning an increase of revenue from these
        properties to roughly $120 million or 300,000 ounces by
        2010.

        Dhanoa’s Acquisitions

        Expert evaluation from industry and regional
        professionals are ongoing on properties that can
        contribute long term quality production and revenue.
        Working with the benefits of shareholders in mind, and
        cash obligations complete, financing of such activities
        may be accomplished based on revenue generated cash and
        stock.

        May 25 - Dhanoa Minerals Projects Annual Revenues of
        $170 million by Second Year of Production

        Dhanoa Minerals Ltd. (OTCBB:DHNA) announced that it has
        completed a resource extraction estimate for its three
        mines in the Bella Rica region of southern Ecuador. End
        of first year production (ending in June, 2008) is
        expected to be around 100,000 ounces of gold,
        generating revenues of around $68 million, with gold at
        $680 per ounce. By the second year, production is
        projected to reach 250,000 ounces of gold per year. The
        three mines (Bonanza, Guanache, and Mollopongo) sit on
        the western end of the Ecuadorian metallurgical gold
        belt, which holds over 10 Million ounces of gold.

        Even if gold remains at their current value, the
        company is confident that it will generate gross
        revenues to total $170 million each year after year two
        of production. However, since the price of gold is
        predicted to increase substantially, Dhanoa's revenues
        could be correspondingly higher.

        "Our company has reached a significant milestone, and
        we're excited about the prospects for the next two
        years," says Mr. Lee Andrew Balak, president of Dhanoa
        Minerals, Ltd. "With the current price of gold and our
        vast reserves, our revenues should considerable."

        May 9 - Dhanoa Appoints Daniel Kuhn as Consultant to
        the Company

        Dhanoa Minerals Ltd. (OTCBB: DHNA)(FRANKFURT: D7Z) is
        pleased to announce that they have hired Daniel Kuhn as
        a consultant to the company.

        Mr. Daniel Kuhn is a long time mine captain who will be
        Dhanoa's on site person to ensure that the company's
        expansion plans are executed as planned. Mr. Kuhns
        mining career spans more than 40 years.

        Daniel Kuhn has worked as a mine captain with INCO in
        Sudbury, Ontario for a period of 30 years. He has
        extensive experience in Latin American for many years
        and has assisted in building many successful mining
        companies in South America as well. The last 5 years at
        INCO was spent in management after having gone through
        an extensive training course based on Loss Control
        Management. He currently is working as a mining
        consultant with International Minerals. He works on
        mine design and plans for the Rio Blanco property in
        the south of Ecuador which is next door to Dhanoa's
        project.

        Mr. Kuhn is an expert in loss prevention and security
        measures on mine sites. Dhanoa hopes that his presence
        on the mine site will be a great tool when it comes to
        loss prevention for the gold that comes out of the
        mine. Many mines have a loss rate of approx 15%, with
        Mr. Kuhn's presence at the site, Dhanoa hopes to
        completely abolish the loss rate as he will be
        implementing certain measures in order to secure the
        mine site and ensure that loss rates are eliminated.

        Having spent at least 21 years as a miner Mr. Kuhn is
        highly qualified in driving tunnels, down and up-ramps,
        raises, ore passes, shafts and stopes. Both mechanized
        and conventional. At Milpo (Peru) he was responsible
        for driving the bins and shaft stations in the worst
        ground conditions at Porvenir. Because he can
        physically demonstrate the processes involved in any of
        these jobs, he is perhaps one of the best mining
        instructors working in South America at this time.

        Development is the most important work in the mine when
        opening up ore reserves. Mines thrive on good
        development miners. The design of stopes, tunnels and
        raises is important , but it is much easier to find
        people who can do the design than it is to find and
        train a crew to drive them. This is where his
        management style pays off in mines. Mr. Kuhn can train
        the supervisory staff in all of those most important
        tasks and they in turn can better instruct and
        supervise their miners on how the job should work.
        Having spent considerable time in gold mines in South
        America he is also able to design efficient stopes,
        open them up, and get them producing in a timely
        fashion. In this area above all others, a broad and
        diversified mining experience is invaluable to a mine.

        Mr. Kuhn will also be present for the pouring of all
        gold bars and will be taking proper accounting of all
        bars that are produced at the site and will ensure that
        they reach their final destination. It is essential
        that any producing company must have an expert on site
        in order sustain the companies operations and assets
        that are being taken out.

        April 10 - Dhanoa Minerals Announces Installation of
        Cameras

        The Company has entered into an agreement with a local
        provider to install within two months cameras and
        satellite dishes at key processing points to broadcast
        24 hours a day 7 days a week to view live on the Dhanoa
        website. This will allow all shareholders of Dhanoa to
        view the pouring of the gold bars and to view the
        property and processing plant. The installation of
        these cameras will also greatly enhance security and
        efficiency. Dhanoa prides itself on providing all
        shareholders tools such as these cameras to be in touch
        with the companies operations.

        April 5 - Dhanoa Announces Production Plans

        Dhanoa Minerals Ltd's (OTCBB: DHNA)(FRANKFURT: D7Z)
        three gold mining operations are located in southern
        Ecuador. The Guanache Mine is the lowest in elevation,
        the Mollopongo Mine is at the top of the mountain,
        while the Bonanza Mine is in between.

        The vertical extent is about 300 meters (over 1,000
        feet). The continuity of the gold vein systems is
        remarkable from top to bottom as well as laterally,
        i.e. along strike. Thus, the favorable ground for
        future exploitation is extraordinarily substantial.

        Dhanoa is finalizing plans to increase the current
        underground production almost five-fold within a six
        month period. The Mollopongo Mine is surrounded by a
        strong halo of gold mineralization, which would be
        amendable to open-pit mining at an initial rate of
        about 2,000 metric tonnes per day. In 1997, Cambior
        Inc., a major Canadian gold producer, conducted a
        thorough evaluation, which provides the basis of
        Dhanoa's planning.

        When on stream, total output of gold could surpass
        40,000 ounces annually. This estimate assumes a
        relatively modest increase in gold recovery from
        presently depressed levels. Dhanoa has identified the
        methods and equipment necessary that will help us reach
        this production goal. Additionally, Dhanoa will be
        evaluating several acquisition targets nearby.

        Security is a vital concern in gold mines. For
        operations such as Dhanoa's, where grades are high and
        the gold grains are visible, losses may exceed 15%. The
        company is in the process of hiring a local supervisor
        to monitor everything from blasting rock to sale of the
        gold. When the new centralized milling complex is
        complete, it will treat all feeds from the mines
        directly, significantly lowering losses while
        materially reducing costs.

        April 4 - Dhanoa Minerals Arranges U.S. $1.3 Million
        Financing at $1.90 per Share

        Dhanoa Minerals Ltd. (OTCBB: DHNA)(FRANKFURT: D7Z) is
        pleased to announce recently that it has arranged a
        private placement of 684,210 shares at a price of $1.90
        U.S. for a total gross proceeds of $1,300,000.

        Dhanoa Minerals Ltd. is arranging a non-brokered
        private placement of 684,210 units at a price of $1.90
        per unit for total gross proceeds of up to $1,300,000.
        The units consist of one common share and one-half of a
        share purchase warrant, with each warrant exercisable
        for $2.00 for another 18 months from the closing date
        of the private placement. A finder's fee in accordance
        with exchange guidelines may be payable on this
        financing. The Warrant is redeemable by Dhanoa without
        consideration upon thirty (30) days notice to the
        Subscriber. The shares of common stock included in the
        units as well as the common shares underlying the
        Warrants are "restricted securities" as that term is
        defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 and
        the units were sold pursuant to an exemption from
        registration requirements provided by Regulation S.

        Proceeds from the private placement will be used to
        finance our planned acquisition in Ecuador, working
        capital to modernize plant, purchase equipment and hire
        more labor and begin the business strategy that we have
        set out for 'Dhanoa'.

<p>Dear Reader,
<p><font color="#000000">Our featured company today, <b>Dhanoa Minerals
Ltd. (OTCBB: DHNA)</b>, is a newly incorporated natural resource exploration
company. It is acquiring, exploring and developing existing and new natural
resource properties thought to contain significant quantities of gold and
other minerals.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">When evaluating small cap gold companies, indications
of revenue are among the most important insight an investor can receive.&nbsp;
These extraction estimates are about as close to a crystal ball as it gets
in the junior mining arena.&nbsp; To this end, recent news from Dhanoa
Minerals seems to be a positive signal to its investors.&nbsp; Dhanoa announced
that it has completed a resource extraction estimate for its three mines
in the Bella Rica region of southern Ecuador.&nbsp; <u>First year production
(ending in June, 2008) is expected to be approximately 100,000 ounces of
gold, generating revenues upwards of $68 million, with gold at $680 per
ounce.&nbsp; By the end of year two, production is projected to reach 250,000
ounces of gold per year. If these levels are reached, revenues could rise
to $170 million within 24 months</u>.&nbsp;</font>

<p><font color="#000000">In the report, the analyst writes, “Dhanoa owns
a 100% interest in two adjacent mineral projects in Canada - Close-Allies
I and Close Allies II.&nbsp; In addition, Dhanoa holds an 80% interest
in an Ecuador mining company, Promenasa.&nbsp; The Company also recently
acquired four properties that are part of the Bonanza Project in the Bellarica
gold mining camp in Ecuador.&nbsp; These are gold producing mines and Dhanoa
plans to significantly increase production by upgrading extrac&shy;tion
operations.”&nbsp; "Dhanoa anticipates production at the end of its first
year (ending June 2008) to be approximately 100,000 ounces of gold. At
recent gold prices, the value of 2008 production would result in approximately
$68 million.”&nbsp;</font>

<blockquote><b><font color="#660000">Dhanoa is a production stage company
formed for the purpose of acquiring, exploring, and developing natural
resource properties. Activities during the production and exploration stage
include further development of the Company's business plan and raising
capital. The Company has recently initiated a new program to evaluate undervalued
assets for potential addition to its mineral claim portfolio.</font></b></blockquote>

<center><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Dhanoa’s Current Operations</font></font></b></center>

<p><font color="#000000">Dhanoa’s Bella Rica project consists of three
mines in Southwest Ecuador, with a current production cost of $280.00 per
ounce. These mines currently operate at a cost of $280.00 per ounce and
are producing enough to reach 100,000 ounces of high grade gold in 2007.
With gold at $680.00 per ounce, this equates to $40 million dollars in
revenue for Dhanoa.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Dhanoa’s Property Study Results</font></font></b></center>

<p><font color="#000000">Dhanoa’s Bonanza properties were most recently
part of a study performed by independent geologist Larry Sostad, an expert
in geophysics, mining exploration, geology, and geochemistry. The random
samples were taken using the various tunnels at the company's three gold
producing mines in southern Ecuador and then sent to an Assayers laboratory
in Canada where they were certified. Of these, the following three were
the most encouraging:</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font color="#000000">A2709-2 238.20 Au g/tonne</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font color="#000000">A2712-1 24.50 Au g/tonne 300.30 Ag g/tonne</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font color="#000000">A2712 78.20 Au g/tonne 144.00 Ag g/tonne</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The industry standard is approximately 20 g/ton.
Reserve estimates, resource samples and estimates are not Ni 43-101 certified.</font>

<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Ecuador</font></font></b></center>

<p><font color="#000000">Southern Ecuador has rapidly become an attractive
choice for mineral exploration/development companies. Permissive geology
in unexplored or under explored areas, a stable mining code, an opportunistic
labor pool, no restrictions on capital flows, and relatively good infrastructure
has led to the recent interest in the country.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Compounding the new exploration interest in Ecuador
is a series of discovery/ development projects that have potential to be
world class. The most recent find is Aurelian’s Fruta Del Norte epithermal
gold discovery in southeastern Ecuador. With less than 20 drill holes in
the discovery area ARU market cap is already at C$600 million.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">This suggests that the market believes ARU is
on to a 5-6 million oz target (using US$100/oz Au). Corriente’s Mirador
Cu-Au project is 14km north of Aurelian’s new discovery and based on current
development plans could be operating by 2008, and within 18 months of start
up producing about 250 million lbs of Cu/yr. In south central Ecuador,
IAMGOLD is developing its Quimsacocha high sulphidation Au project.&nbsp;
The company has outlined thus far a 2.8 million ounce gold resource. The
resource is open as evidenced by step out drilling along strike and we
expect an updated resource calculation this fall. Preliminary mine plans
suggest that an open pit operation could produce about 230,000 ounces of
Au per year.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Mining Law</font></font></b></center>

<p><font color="#000000">There are internal and international pressures
for Ecuador to reduce its reliance on agriculture and oil. In August 2000,
Ecuador revised its mining law to make it more attractive for foreign investment
including the ability for foreigners to own 100% interest in mining properties.
In 2002, government royalties on mining were eliminated. The current tax
rate in Ecuador is 25%.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The right to explore for and exploit minerals
is granted via way of mining concessions that are valid for 30 years and
renewable. Concessions have exclusive rights and are defensible against
third parties. Concessions are up to a maximum size of 5,000 hectares each,
but there is no limit on the number of concessions held. Annual concession
fees are payable with fees ranging from US$1.00 per hectare up to US$16.00
per hectare starting in year 13 of holding the title.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Upon a production decision the operator submits
an Initial Declaration of Production (IDP) together with an Environmental
Impact Study (EIS). The EIS must be approved by the Ministry of the Environment.
Surface rights are independent of mineral rights.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">Ecuador can be divided into five north – south
trending physiographic regions that extend north and south respectively
into Columbia and Peru. The main metallogenic regions of interest include:
the Western Cordillera (accreted Cretaceous to Eocene volcanics and intrusive
rocks), and the Eastern Cordillera (includes Mesozoic intrusives) that
occur in central and eastern Ecuador. Regional north trending basement
structures are important controls on Tertiary volcanism in the Western
Cordillera, and thus emplacement of porphyry, skarn and epithermal styles
of mineralization. In the Eastern Cordillera, Corriente Resources is targeting
Cu porphyry mineralization in older Jurassic intrusive rocks. Aurelian
Resources has discovered epithermal Au mineralization within the same belt
of Jurassic rocks as those being explored by Corriente. In addition, epithermal
gold associated with skarn hosts exist in the same eastern belt; the Nambija
prospect is believed to have been one of the most prolific Spanish mining
operations in the sixteenth century. The most easterly physiographic region,
the Oriente, is host to Mesozoic sediments which contain most of the hydrocarbon
reserves in Ecuador.</font></td>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Dhanoa Minerals LTD</font></b><font color="#000000">
is on schedule to complete its acquisition of an 80% interest in three
gold mining operations in Southern Ecuador, referred to as the Bella Rica
project. The Guanache Mine is the lowest in elevation, the Mollopongo Mine
is at the top of the mountain, while the Bonanza Mine is in between. The
vertical extent is a little more than 1000 feet, and the continuity of
the gold vein systems run horizontal as well as vertical. It has become
very clear that Dhanoa has established itself on favorable ground for extraordinary
expansion and development.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Part of Dhanoa’s growth strategy is to undertake
underground expansion, open pit development, and creating a centralized
modern treatment plant for the production of gold and silver. Dhanoa anticipates
the Bonanza mine to reach a rate of 100,000 ounces of gold through the
next 12 months and then building to 300,000 ounces annually, as indicated
by increasing production levels already being achieved. The goal is to
produce 12 gr. per ton average in high grade gold.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Dhanoa wants to continue to pursue new exploration
interests using revenues (projected at $ 40 MM for 2007) for acquisitions
and facility upgrades or installations. All the properties, and most formidably
the Bonanza mine, are also located in an area where Dhanoa is strategically
positioned within an emerging gold</font>
<br><font color="#000000">arena of international stature.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">They are actively employing state-of-the-art concepts
for production and security. In mines such as these, where grades are high
and the gold grains are visible, losses may exceed 15%. By the end of June,
they will be installing cameras for 24X7 monitoring of their gold processing.
Their intent is to make the live camera feed available on-line through
their website as a means of providing security and enabling shareholders
to view the extent of the operations up close.</font></blockquote>

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Dhanoa
Minerals Ltd. (OTCBB:DHNA) announced that it has completed a resource extraction
estimate for its three mines in the Bella Rica region of southern Ecuador.
End of first year production (ending in June, 2008) is expected to be around
100,000 ounces of gold, generating revenues of around $68 million, with
gold at $680 per ounce. By the second year, production is projected to
reach 250,000 ounces of gold per year. The three mines (Bonanza, Guanache,
and Mollopongo) sit on the western end of the Ecuadorian metallurgical
gold belt, which holds over 10 Million ounces of gold.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Even
if gold remains at their current value, the company is confident that it
will generate gross revenues to total $170 million each year after year
two of production. However, since the price of gold is predicted to increase
substantially, Dhanoa's revenues could be correspondingly higher.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>"Our
company has reached a significant milestone, and we're excited about the

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Dhanoa
Minerals Ltd. (OTCBB: DHNA)(FRANKFURT: D7Z) is pleased to announce that
they have hired Daniel Kuhn as a consultant to the company.</font></font></font>

Daniel Kuhn is a long time mine captain who will be Dhanoa's on site person
to ensure that the company's expansion plans are executed as planned. Mr.
Kuhns mining career spans more than 40 years.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Daniel
Kuhn has worked as a mine captain with INCO in Sudbury, Ontario for a period
of 30 years. He has extensive experience in Latin American for many years
and has assisted in building many successful mining companies in South
America as well. The last 5 years at INCO was spent in management after
having gone through an extensive training course based on Loss Control
Management. He currently is working as a mining consultant with International
Minerals. He works on mine design and plans for the Rio Blanco property
in the south of Ecuador which is next door to Dhanoa's project.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Mr.
Kuhn is an expert in loss prevention and security measures on mine sites.
Dhanoa hopes that his presence on the mine site will be a great tool when
it comes to loss prevention for the gold that comes out of the mine. Many
mines have a loss rate of approx 15%, with Mr. Kuhn's presence at the site,
Dhanoa hopes to completely abolish the loss rate as he will be implementing
certain measures in order to secure the mine site and ensure that loss
rates are eliminated.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Having
spent at least 21 years as a miner Mr. Kuhn is highly qualified in driving
tunnels, down and up-ramps, raises, ore passes, shafts and stopes. Both
mechanized and conventional. At Milpo (Peru) he was responsible for driving
the bins and shaft stations in the worst ground conditions at Porvenir.
Because he can physically demonstrate the processes involved in any of
these jobs, he is perhaps one of the best mining instructors working in
South America at this time.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Development
is the most important work in the mine when opening up ore reserves. Mines
thrive on good development miners. The design of stopes, tunnels and raises
is important , but it is much easier to find people who can do the design
than it is to find and train a crew to drive them. This is where his management
style pays off in mines. Mr. Kuhn can train the supervisory staff in all
of those most important tasks and they in turn can better instruct and
supervise their miners on how the job should work. Having spent considerable
time in gold mines in South America he is also able to design efficient
stopes, open them up, and get them producing in a timely fashion. In this
area above all others, a broad and diversified mining experience is invaluable
to a mine.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Mr.
Kuhn will also be present for the pouring of all gold bars and will be
taking proper accounting of all bars that are produced at the site and
will ensure that they reach their final destination. It is essential that
any producing company must have an expert on site in order sustain the
companies operations and assets that are being taken out.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>The
vertical extent is about 300 meters (over 1,000 feet). The continuity of
the gold vein systems is remarkable from top to bottom as well as laterally,
i.e. along strike. Thus, the favorable ground for future exploitation is
extraordinarily substantial.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Dhanoa
is finalizing plans to increase the current underground production almost
five-fold within a six month period. The Mollopongo Mine is surrounded
by a strong halo of gold mineralization, which would be amendable to open-pit
mining at an initial rate of about 2,000 metric tonnes per day. In 1997,
Cambior Inc., a major Canadian gold producer, conducted a thorough evaluation,
which provides the basis of Dhanoa's planning.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>When
on stream, total output of gold could surpass 40,000 ounces annually. This
estimate assumes a relatively modest increase in gold recovery from presently
depressed levels. Dhanoa has identified the methods and equipment necessary
that will help us reach this production goal. Additionally, Dhanoa will
be evaluating several acquisition targets nearby.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Security
is a vital concern in gold mines. For operations such as Dhanoa's, where
grades are high and the gold grains are visible, losses may exceed 15%.
The company is in the process of hiring a local supervisor to monitor everything
from blasting rock to sale of the gold. When the new centralized milling
complex is complete, it will treat all feeds from the mines directly, significantly
lowering losses while materially reducing costs.</font></font></font>
