The  Evening Grosbeak , Coccothraustes vespertinus, is a large finch. In the
past, it was treated in a genus of its own as Hesperiphona vespertina, but is
now usually placed in the same genus as the Hawfinch of Eurasia.

The breeding habitat is coniferous and mixed forest across Canada and the
western mountainous areas of the United States and Mexico. The nest is built on
a horizontal branch or in a fork of a tree.

The migration of this bird is variable  in some winters, it may wander as far
south as the southern U.S. , Ontario, Canada]] The Evening Grosbeak is 18.5 cm
long. The adult has a short black tail, black wings and a large pale bill. The
adult male has a bright yellow forehead and body  its head is brown and there is
a large white patch in the wing. The adult female is mainly olive brown, greyer
on the underparts and with white patches in the wings.

These birds forage in trees and bushes, sometimes on the ground. They mainly eat
seeds, berries and insects. Outside of the nesting season, they often feed in
flocks. Sometimes, they will swallow fine gravel for the salts.

The range of this bird has expanded far to the east in historical times,
possibly due to plantings of Manitoba maples and other maples and shrubs around
farms and the availability of bird feeders in winter.

/Worcester/ /pronounced / is a city in the Midlands of England, an

d the county
town of Worcestershire. It is situated some 30 miles /48 km/ southwest of
Bir

mingham and 29 miles /47 km/ north of Gloucester. The River Severn runs
through the middle

, with the city/s large cathedral overlooking the river.

History Occupation of the site o

f Worcester can be dated back to neolithic
times, a village surrounded by defensive rampar

ts having been founded on the
eastern bank of the River Severn here in around 400 BC. The 

position, which
commanded a ford on the river, was in the 1st century used by the Romans t

o
establish what may at first have been a fort on the military route from Glevum
/Gloucest

er/ to Viroconium /Wroxeter/ but which soon developed /mdash/ as the
frontier of the empir

e was pushed westwards /mdash/ into an industrial town with
its own pottery kilns and iron

/smelting plants.

Roman Worcester /which may have been the Vertis mentioned in the 7th ce

ntury
Ravenna Cosmography/ was a thriving trading and manufacturing centre for some
three 

hundred years, though by the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain in
407 it had dwind

led considerably in size and is not recorded again until the mid/
7th century when documen

ts mention the Anglo/Saxon settlement of
[http///ang.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiogoraceastre Weo

gornaceaster]. The fact that
Worcester was chosen at this time /ndash/ in preference to bo

th the much larger
Gloucester and the royal centre of Winchcombe /ndash/ to be the Episcop

al See of
a new diocese covering the area suggests that there was a well established, and


powerful, English Christian community living on the site when it fell into
English hands.



The town was almost destroyed in 1041 after a rebellion against the punitive
taxation of 

Harthacanute. The town was attacked several times in the civil war
/in 1139, 1150 and 1151

/ between King Stephen and Empress Matilda, daughter of
Henry I.

By late medieval times t

he population had grown to around 10,000 as the
manufacture of cloth started to become a l

arge local industry. The town was
designated a county corporate, giving it autonomy from l

ocal government.



Worcester was the site of the Battle of Worcester /September 3, 1651/,

 when
Charles II/s attempt to regain the crown by force was decisively defeated, in
the fi

elds a little to the west and south of the city, near the village of
Powick. After being d

efeated, Charles returned to his headquarters in what is
now known as King Charles house i

n the Cornmarket, before fleeing in disguise to
Boscobel House in Shropshire and his event

ual escape to France. Worcester was
one of the cities loyal to the King in that war, for w

hich it was given the
epithet /The Faithful City/.

The Royal Worcester Porcelain Company 

factory was founded by Dr John Wall in
1750, although it no longer produces goods. A handf

ul of decorators are still
employed at the factory and the Museum is still open.

During t

he 18th century Worcester/s trade languished compared to more modern
towns of the West Mid

lands. The Worcester and Birmingham Canal opened in 1815
allowing Worcester goods to be tr

ansported to a larger conurbation.

The British Medical Association /BMA/ is reputed to ha

ve been founded in the
Board Room of the old Worcester Royal Infirmary building in Castle 

Street around
1860. This building has now been closed and /as of 2006/ will be redeveloped

 as
the University of Worcester city campus.

In the 1950s and 1960s large areas of the me

dieval centre of Worcester were
demolished and rebuilt as a result of decisions by town pl

anners. There is still
a significant area of medieval Worcester remaining, but it is a sma

ll fraction
of what was present before the redevelopments.

The current city boundaries da

te from 1974, when the Local Government Act 1972
transferred the parishes of Warndon and S

t. Peter the Great County into the
city.

Politics The city council is currently controlle

d by the Conservative Party, who
hold 18 of the council/s 35 seats.

Worcester has one mem
