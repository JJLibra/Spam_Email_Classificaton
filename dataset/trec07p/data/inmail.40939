Dear valued member.
If you are buying drugs on the Web frequently, please, read this letter to the end since it contains really important information for you.
Recently, a research aimed at monitoring the quality of the drugs sold at the most popular online pharmacies has been made. The results of this research were rather surprising. Only one out of 53 Web drugstores – USDrugs – has proved its meds to be 100% generic.
Take care of your health – use generic drugs from licensed manufacturers and providers only!
