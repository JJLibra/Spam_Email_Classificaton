The company announced that a preliminary oceanographic survey was begun last week on the Anchor Gold project. This survey was intended to both confirm the results of Aspen Exploration's previous work and to provide baseline information for a drilling program planned for later in the 2007 exploration season. It is believed that due to the size of the project area, it could have great potential.</p>
                                                        <p align=3D"justify">Hemis also recently expanded its El Tigre land holdings through the acquisition of concessions called La Centela. La Centela consists of six concessions that are adjacent to El Tigre. The El Tigre gold exploration project in eastern Sonora, Mexico, is currently undergoing an initial phase of diamond drilling. The initial phase of drilling is intended to test several gold-bearing breccia zones. Hemis initially considered El Tigre to be strictly a gold target, nut has also shown evidence of the mineral molybdenum porphyry is and more testing is warranted at El Tigre. Hemis is expecting the results from the first hole this week with the results of additional holes to be received on a weekly basis going forward. Hemis also announced last month that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Aspen Exploration Corporation's Anchor Point gold project in the Cook Inlet area of Alaska. </p>
