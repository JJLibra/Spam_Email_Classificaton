About 30 species  see text   

A  pear  is a tree of the genus Pyrus and the juicy fruit of that tree, edible
in some species. The English word pear is probably from Common West Germanic
 pera, probably a loanword of Vulgar Latin pira, the plural of pirum, which is
itself of unknown origin. See also Peor  . The place name   Perry   can indicate
the historical presence of pear trees.

The pear is member of the natural order Rosaceae, belonging to the same genus as
the apple  P. malus , which it resembles in floral structure. In both cases the
so called fruit is composed of the receptacle or upper end of the flower stalk
 the so called calyx tube  greatly dilated, and enclosing within its cellular
flesh the five cartilaginous carpels which constitute the  core  and are really
the true fruit. From the upper rim of the receptacle are given off the five
sepals, the five petals, and the very numerous stamens. Another major relative
of the pear  and thus the apple  is the quince.

The form of the pear and of the apple respectively, although usually
characteristic enough, is not by itself sufficient to distinguish them, for
there are pears which cannot by form alone be distinguished from apples, and
apples which cannot by superficial appearance be recognized from pears. The main
distinction is the occurrence in the tissue of the fruit, or beneath the rind,
of clusters of cells filled with hard woody deposit in the case of the pear,
constituting the  grit,  while in the apple no such formation of woody cells
takes place. The appearance of the tree mdash the bark, the foliage, the
flowers mdash is, however, usually quite characteristic in the two species.

Cultivated pears, whose number is enormous, are without doubt derived from one
or two wild species widely distributed throughout Europe and western Asia, and
sometimes forming part of the natural vegetation of the forests. In England,
where the pear is sometimes considered wild, there is always the doubt that it
may not really be so, but the produce of some seed of a cultivated tree
deposited by birds or otherwise, which has degenerated into the wild spine 
bearing tree known as   Pyrus communis  .

The cultivation of the pear extends to the remotest antiquity. Traces of it have
been found in the Swiss lake dwellings  it is mentioned in the oldest Greek
writings, and was cultivated by the Romans. The word  pear  or its equivalent
occurs in all the Celtic languages, while in Slavonic and other dialects
different appellations, but still referring to the same thing, are found ndash a
diversity and multiplicity of nomenclature which led Alphonse de Candolle to
infer a very ancient cultivation of the tree from the shores of the Caspian to
those of the Atlantic. A certain race of pears, with white down on the under
surface of their leaves, is supposed to have originated from P. nivalis, and
their fruit is chiefly used in France in the manufacture of Perry  see Cider .
Other small fruited pears, distinguished by their precocity and apple like
fruit, may be referred to P. cordate, a species found wild in western France,
and in Devonshire and Cornwall.

Botany Pears are native to coastal and mildly temperate regions of the Old
World, from western Europe and north Africa east right across Asia. They are
medium sized trees, reaching 10 17 m tall, often with a tall, narrow crown  a
few species are shrubby. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, 2 12 cm
long, glossy green on some species, densely silvery hairy in some others  leaf
shape varies from broad oval to narrow lanceolate. Most pears are deciduous, but
one or two species in southeast Asia are evergreen. Most are cold hardy,
withstanding temperatures between  minus 25   C and  minus 40   C in winter,
except for the evergreen species, which only tolerate temperatures down to about
 minus 15   C.

The flowers are white, rarely tinted yellow or pink, 2 4 cm diameter, and have
five petals. Like that of the related apple, the pear fruit is a pome, in most
wild species 1 4 cm diameter, but in some cultivated forms up to 18 cm long and
8 cm broad  the shape varies from globose in most species, to the classic  pear 
shape  of the European Pear with an elongated basal portion and a bulbous end.

The pear is very similar to the apple in cultivation, propagation and
pollination.

There are about 30 species of pears. Selected species

/The University of Pretoria/ is a university in South Africa, with a total 

of
about 38,499 students being enrolled in 2005. This makes it the country/s
largest resid

ential /contact/ university.

History

The Pretoria branch of the Transvaal University Col

lege /TUC/ was the forerunner
of the University of Pretoria. /The nickname for this univer

sity / Tuks or
Tukkies / is derived from the TUC acronym./

The college commenced its acti

vities as an Afrikaans language institution in
1908 with a staff consisting of four profes

sors and three lecturers. Thirty/two
students were enrolled for courses at the first campu

s, Kya Rosa, a house in the
centre of Pretoria.

The University of Pretoria became a fully

 fledged university in 1930.

As in all other sections of South African society, considera

ble transformation
has taken place here since the end of apartheid in 1994. This began the


transformation of the university from a mainly white, Afrikaner institution, to
a nationa

l university in the true sense of the word, accessible to all South
Africans.

Student pro

file During 2005, 38 499 residential students /compared to 28 093 in
2000/, were registere

d for contact teaching at the University.

Of this number, 28 252 were undergraduates /com

pared to 20 211 in 2000/, and 10
247 were postgraduates /compared to 7 882 in 2000/. The g

ender composition was
47/ male and 53/ female students. There were 60/ white students and 

40/ black
students.

As regards language preference, 60/ of the undergraduate student body

 prefer to
learn in Afrikaans but almost 70/ of the post graduate students prefer their
in

struction in English.

Besides the residential students, almost 13 000 students / of whom 

95/ were
black / were enrolled in the University/s distance education programmes, mainly
i

n the Faculty of Education.

Thus, the total student population /residential and non/resid

ential/ was 51 499,
of which 54/ was black.

In 2005 there were more than 2 200 internatio

nal students on campus,
representing 60 countries.

More than 1 000 students came from SAD

C countries and approximately 500 from
other African countries.

Student life Sport
/ Hist

ory/
TuksSport

The University of Pretoria boasts world/class sports facilities, providing

 its
students with opportunities to participate on club, national and international
levels

 in a wide variety of sports disciplines. In 2006, TuksSport once again
had a fantastic ye

ar in as far as the outstanding achievements of its sportsmen
/ /women were concerned. The

 University of Pretoria produced 100 Senior Proteas
and Springboks, underlining the fact t

hat it is currently the largest provider
of athletes to the various national teams.

There

 are 30 registered sport clubs at the University of Pretoria, in which more
than 10 000 st

udents take part on a competitive and recreational level, and more
than 1 000 volunteers a

re involved in sport in various designations and
capacities.

constituting the  grit, /> while in the apple no such< formation of woody cells
takes place/>. T<he appe/>aranc<e of t/>he tree mdash the bar<k, the foliage, the
flowers md/>ash is, however, usually <quite characteristic in the two/> species.

Cultivated p<ars/>s, whose number is <enormous, are with/>out doubt derived from one
or two w<ld species/>s wide<ly/> distributed <h/>hroughout Europe a<nd western Asi/>ia, and
sometimes f<rming part of the natura/>l vegetation of the forest<s. In E/>England,
where the pear is sometim<s considered w/>wild, there is always the doubt th<at it
may not really b/>be so, bu<t/> the produce of some se<d of a cultivate/>d tree
deposited by birds or otherwise,< whic/>ch has degener<ted into the wild spine/>e 
bearing tree known as  <Pyrus communis  .

The cultiv/>ation of the pear extend<s to/> the remotest antiquity. Trac<es of it have
been found in t/>he Swiss lake dwellings  it <is mentioned in the oldest Greek
writin/>gs, and was cultivated by the Rom<ns. The word  pear  or its/>s equivalent
occu<s in all the Celti/>c languages, <while in Slavonic /> and other dialects
different appe<lations, but still referring t/>o the <same thing, are found nd/>dash a
diversity and mult<plicity of nomenclature which led Alph/>honse de Candolle to
infer a ve<ry an/>cient cultivation of the tree fr<m th/>he shores of the Caspian to
those o<f the Atlantic. A certain/> race o<f pears, with white down on the under/>r
surface of their <leaves, is supposed to have ori/>ginated from P. nivalis, and
their frui< is chiefly used in France in/>n the manufacture of <Perry  see Cide/>r .
Other small fru<ited pears, distinguished by their prec/>ocity a<d apple like
fruit, may be/>e referred to P. cordate<, /> a species found wild in western France<
and in Devons/>sh<re and /> Cornwall.

B<otany Pears are nativ/>e to coastal<a/>and mildly temperate regions of t<he Old
World, from western Eur/>ope and north Africa east right across <sia./> The<y are
medium/>m sized trees, reaching 10 1< m tall, often with a tall, narrow cr/>rown  a
few speci<s are shrubby. The leave/>s are <alter/>rnately arranged, simple, 2 12 cm
l<ong, glossy green />on some specie<s, densely/>y sil<e/>ery hairy in some oth<ers  leaf
shape v/>varies from broad oval t< narrow lanceolate. Most pears are deci/>iduous,< but/>
one or two species in southeast A<sia are evergreen. Most are cold hardy/>y,
withstanding temperatures b<tween  minus 25/>   C and  minus 40 <  />C in winter,
except for the ever<reen species, which only toler/>rat< tempera/>atures down to about
 minus<15   C.

The /> flowers are white, rarely tinted y<ellow or pink, 2 4 cm diameter, and/>d have
five petals< Like that o/>of<the re/>lated apple, the pear fru<it is a pome/>e, in most
wild species 1 4 c< diameter, but in some cultiv/>ated forms< up to 18 cm long and
8 cm broad  the/> shape varies from gl<obose in most/> species, to the classic  pear <
shape  of the European Pear w/>with an elongated basal por<tion and a bulbous/> end.

The pear is very simil<r to the apple/>e in<cultivation, pr/>ropagation and
pol<ination.
