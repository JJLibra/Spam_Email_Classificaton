Imagine       being  part   of a   stable      organization     with   a sterling      reputation      -    a   place       where      the      Sydney      Car   Centre      is  an     integral     part of  all that     we       do.

Today the     Sydney     Car     Centre  is       looking   for an      industrious   regional       assistant    to   fasten the    process       of       the    delivery       of       customer      payments   to     the       suppliers.

As     a    regional  assistant,       you       will   be      supposed    to     operate    with  the      payments    from those   customers,   based     in    your      country.   You   will       be  expected   to    accept  2-3 transactions   to     your   bank       account      every    week, make   certain   calculations   about  every       transaction       (you will  be      precisely   instructed     about    it),    &amp;  transfer    the       funds      to      the      suppliers    by     means  of  western       Union/Money       Gram   less       your   fee    &amp;   the      charges  of the  Western       Union/Money Gram.       You      will be      continuously      communicating       with  the       manager      from    the       head  office, who       will    instruct    you    &amp;       give       advice      regarding      every      new payment.<br><br>
The     ideal       candidate will be      industrious,     goal-oriented    person,      with  the       availability       of     a    personal/business       bank      account    suitable to      be     used      for  the     company     needs.     Knowledge      of       English,    computer     literacy    and  sociability     are     appreciated.<br><br>
