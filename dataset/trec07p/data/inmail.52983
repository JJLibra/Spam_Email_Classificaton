 Day care  or  child care  are terms used to describe the care of a child during
the day by a person other than the child s parents or legal guardians, typically
someone outside the child s immediate family. In the United Kingdom and
Australia the term child care is normally used. In America the term day care is
used. Child care or day care is provided in nurseries or creches or by
childminders caring for children in their own homes.

 [[Babysitting]]  is the occasional temporary care of a child during the absence
of his or her parents. Child care or day care usually refers to ongoing care
during specific periods, such as the parents  time at work. Child care can also
take on a more formal structure, with education, child development, discipline
and even preschool falling into the fold of services.

Some childminders care for children from several families at the same time,
either in their own home or in a specialized child care facility. Some employers
provide nursery provision for their employees at or near the place of
employment.

Child care in the child s own home is traditionally provided by a nanny or au
pair.

History Day care appeared in France about 1840, and the Soci  t   des Cr  ches
was recognized by the French government in 1869. Originating in Europe in the
late 18th and early 19th century, day cares were established in the United
States by private charities in the 1850s, the first being the New York Day
Nursery in 1854.

Day care industry

The day care industry is a continuum from personal parental care to large,
regulated institutions. The vast majority of childcare is still performed by the
parents, in house nanny or through informal arrangements with relatives,
neighbors or friends. For example, in Canada, among two parent families with at
least one working parent, 62  of parents handle the childcare themselves, 32 
have other in home care  nannies, relatives, neighbours or friends  and only
6.5  use a formal day careadmin/books/chapterfiles/Private 20Sector 20Can 20Meet 20Child 20Care 20Demands 
Mar04fftaylor.pdf /ref .

Where the market is sufficiently large or there are government subsidies for
daycare, for profit corporate day care exists. In North America, Bright Horizons
Family Solutions is one of the largest such companies ref http //www.fool.com/n 
ews/commentary/2003/commentary030918sm.htm /ref . It is a publicly traded
company operating over 600 daycare
centers ref http //www.brighthorizons.com/site/pages/investors.aspx /ref . The
Australian government s childcare subsidy has allowed the creation of a large
private sector industry in that country ref http //www.facs.gov.au/internet/fac 
sinternet.nsf/VIA/childcare/$File/childcare.pdf /ref . ABC Learning Centres is a
publicly traded company running 644 daycare centres in
Australia ref http //childcare.com.au/corporate/corporate_01.htm /ref . Another
factor favoring large corporate day cares is the existence of childcare
facilities in the workplace. Large corporations will not handle this employee
benefit directly themselves and will seek out large corporate providers to
manage their corporate daycares. Most smaller, for profit day cares operate out
of a single location.

Non profit day cares have some structural advantages over for profit operations.</STYLE>
