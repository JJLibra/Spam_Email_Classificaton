    Hans Christian Andersen  or simply  H.C. Andersen  ,  April 2 1805    
August 4 1875  was a Danish author and poet most famous for his fairy tales.

Personal life Andersen was born in Odense, Denmark, on Tuesday, April 2 1805.

Andersen s father apparently believed that he might be related to nobility, and
according to scholars at the Hans Christian Andersen Center, his paternal
grandmother told him that the family had once been in a higher social class.
However, investigation proves these stories unfounded. The family apparently did
have some connections to Danish royalty, but these were work related.
Nevertheless, the theory that Andersen was the illegitimate son of royalty
persists in Denmark, bolstered by the fact that the Danish King took a personal
interest in Andersen as a youth and paid for his education. The writer Rolf
Dorset insists that not all options have been explored in determining Andersen s
heritage.

Andersen displayed great intelligence and imagination as a young boy, a trait
fostered by the indulgence of his parents and by the superstition of his mother.
He made himself a small toy theatre and sat at home making clothes for his
puppets, and reading all the plays that he could lay his hands upon  among them
were those of Ludvig Holberg and William Shakespeare. Throughout his childhood,
he had a passionate love for literature. He was known to memorize entire plays
by Shakespeare and to recite them using his wooden dolls as actors. He was also
a great lover of the art of banter, and assisted in initiating a society of like
minded banterers amongst his friends.

In 1816, his father died and the young boy had to start earning a living. He
worked as an apprentice for both a weaver and a tailor, and later worked in a
cigarette factory where his fellow workers humiliated him by betting on whether
he was in fact a girl, pulling down his trousers to check. At the age of
fourteen, Andersen moved to Copenhagen seeking employment as an actor in the
theatre. He had a pleasant soprano voice and succeeded in being admitted to the
Royal Danish Theatre. This career stopped short when his voice broke. A
colleague at the theatre had referred to him as a poet, and Andersen took this
