I have no problem with an erections but they do not last as long as when I was 40 or so. Viagra gets me erect faster and I stay erect longer after orgasms so we can still play. Round two also arrives much sooner and I am hard quicker and longer. No side effects I know of other than the fact that sex is much improved. The effects last 3 or 4 hours, and it takes 30 to 45 minutes to kick in. 25 or 50 mg tabs work the same for me, no difference. Go for it...

Amazing result, you don't know how happy I am. Viagra changed my life. No anxiety about erection. This also solved premature ejaculation. After trying Viagra, even if they sold it at three times the price, I would still buy it. Those who didn't try Viagra and passed away from this world are very unlucky! I am also a little unlucky, I wish I had try Viagra 3  years earlier.<br>
