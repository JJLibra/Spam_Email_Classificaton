 Mississippi   IPA     IPA   is a state located in the southern region of the
United States of America. It is considered part of the Deep South. The state
takes its name from the Mississippi River, which flows along its western
boundary. Famous Mississippians include Jefferson Davis, the only President of
the Confederacy, authors William Faulkner, John Grisham, Walker Percy, Tennessee
Williams, and Eudora Welty, entertainer Elvis Presley, and Senate Minority Whip
C. Trent Lott, Sr.. Mississippi is also home to a number of American football
stars, including Chicago Bears great Walter Payton, Brett Favre, Jerry Rice,
Archie Manning, and Steve McNair.

Name The name Mississippi, which means  great river,  comes from either Ojibwe,
a Native American language spoken around the river s headwaters, or some other
closely related Algonquian language  c.f. Ojibwe misi ziibi . ref   ref 
Nicknames for Mississippi are the Magnolia State and the Hospitality State.

Geography Mississippi is bordered on the north by the state of Tennessee, on the
east by Alabama, on the south by Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico, and on the
west by Louisiana and Arkansas  across the Mississippi River .

Major rivers include Mississippi River, Big Black River, Pearl River, Yazoo
River, Pascagoula River, and Tombigbee River. Major lakes include Ross Barnett
Reservoir, Arkabutla Lake, Sardis Lake, and Grenada Lake.

The highest point in Mississippi, part of the foothills of the Cumberland
Mountains is Woodall Mountain. Hardly a mountain, Woodall Mountain is only 806
feet  246 nbsp m  above sea level. The lowest point is along the shore at the
Gulf of Mexico  sea level. The Mean Elevation is 300 feet  91 nbsp m  above sea
level.

Most of Mississippi is part of the East Gulf Coastal Plain, and the rest of the
state is made up of a section of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. The East Gulf
Coastal Plain is generally composed of low hills, such as the Pine Hills in the
south and the North Central Hills. Somewhat higher elevations are in the
Pontotoc Ridge and the Fall Line Hills in the northeast. Yellow brown loess soil
is in the west, and a region of fertile black earth, part of the Black Belt, is
in the northeast. The coastline, which includes large bays at Bay Saint Louis,
Biloxi, and Pascagoula, is separated from the Gulf of Mexico proper by the
shallow Mississippi Sound, which is partially enclosed by Petit Bois, Horn,
Ship, and Cat islands. The Mississippi Alluvial Plain, known also as the
Mississippi Delta, is narrow in the south and widens north of Vicksburg. The
region has rich soil, partly made up of silt deposited by floodwaters of the
Mississippi River.

Areas under the management of the National Park Service include   Brices Cross
Roads National Battlefield Site near Baldwyn  Gulf Islands National Seashore
 Natchez National Historical Park in Natchez  Natchez Trace Parkway  Tupelo
National Battlefield in Tupelo  Vicksburg National Cemetery in Vicksburg
 Vicksburg National Military Park also in Vicksburg

Climate Mississippi has a warm humid subtropical climate with long summers and
short, mild winters. Temperatures average about 82  F  about 28  C  in July and
about 48   F  about 9   C  in January. The temperature varies little across the
state in summer, but in winter the region near Mississippi Sound is
significantly warmer than most of the rest of the state. The recorded
temperature in Mississippi has ranged from  19   F   28.3   C , in 1966, at
Corinth in the northeast, to 115   F  46.1   C , in 1930, at Holly Springs in
the north. Yearly precipitation generally increases from north to south. Thus,
Clarksdale, in the northwest, gets about 50 inches  about 1,270 nbsp mm  of
precipitation annually and Biloxi, in the south, about 61 inches  about
1,550 nbsp mm . Small amounts of snow fall in northern and central Mississippi,
although snow is not unheard of around the southern part of the state.

In the late summer and the fall, the state  especially the southern part  is
often affected by hurricanes moving north from the Gulf of Mexico, and
occasionally impacted by major hurricanes, which can be quite devastating in
coastal communities. Thunderstorms are common in Mississippi, especially in the
southern part of the state. On average, Mississippi has around 27 tornadoes
annually with the northern part of the state more vulnerable earlier in the year
and the southern part becoming more vulnerable a little later.
