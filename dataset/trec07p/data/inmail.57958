        Dear Reader,

        Sometimes circular logic does make sense.  And when
        said logic leads to a better mousetrap development in
        the burgeoning health care field, it might just be time
        for investors to take notice.

        Today’s featured company, Imaging3, Inc. (OTCBB: IMGG),
        has literally broadened the dimensions of fluoroscopic
        technology, developing a device that creates a full
        spectrum of images by using a full circle approach to
        the patient instead of viewing only part of his or her
        anatomy.

        The result of this ‘circular logic’ is exponential.
        It’s more thorough, faster, and is expected to create
        and allow for procedures currently impossible with
        status quo equipment.

        Regular StockUpTicks readers are well aware of our
        interest in the sure-fire growth of the health care
        sector. Now, we’re pleased to bring you a better
        mousetrap invention that could potentially redefine one
        of health care’s most critical and widely used
        services.  And management indicates that there are
        currently NO DIRECT COMPETITORS in the marketplace
        providing the same 3D, real-time, high resolution
        deliverable.  Could this single technology obsolete
        what is now a $4 billion medical imaging market?  We
        think it's worth a close look.  Please take a moment to
        examine this fascinating company.

        Imaging3, Inc., OTCBB: IMGG ("Imaging3") was founded in
        1993 and is based in Burbank, California. Imaging3
        became a leading provider of advanced technology
        medical imaging devices. Fourteen years later, Imaging3
        is one of the most respected, long-standing medical
        device manufacturers, distributors and third-party
        service providers in the industry.

        Shortly after the Millennium began Imaging3 began
        looking into the future of medical imaging devices and
        began developing a breakthrough technology, known as
        the Dominion ™, which utilizes high-resolution
        photo-fluoroscopy to produce three-dimensional medical
        diagnostic images, in real-time.

                  [Image]aaaaaaaa[Image]aaaaaaa[Image]

        Imaging3 patented the breakthrough Dominion technology
        and stands to benefit in a multitude of medical
        sectors, including: trauma, cardiology, pain
        management, pediatrics, orthopedics, sports medicine,
        vascular, and neuro-vascular among others. The
        Dominion’s 3D, real-time imaging capabilities allows
        surgeons to complete less invasive and more precise
        procedures. This ability is valuable to the patient,
        the surgical team, the facility, and the insurer.

        This revolutionary technology represents a turning
        point in medical imaging and will enable new procedures
        not possible today and improve existing procedures
        through increased speed and greater accuracy. The
        Dominion, in addition to 3D real-time fluoroscopic
        imaging, is capable of emulating other imaging
        technology, such as CT scans, and does so at a fraction
        of the cost. The Dominion is mobile, will fit through a
        standard room door, and is powered by a standard wall
        outlet.

                     The Dominion ™ 3D Imaging Unit

        By increasing throughput while improving diagnostic and
        clinical accuracy, Imaging3 technology becomes an
        attractive new technology that will provide patients
        with reduced risk in surgery and shorter recovery
        times, dramatically improve physician productivity and
        provide healthcare centers with a higher return on
        investment.

        Imaging3 can provide 3D images that are instantly
        constructed in real-time, and can be used for any
        current or new medical procedures in which multiple
        frames of reference are required to perform medical
        procedures on or in the human body.

           Imagine for a moment ... a future healthcare center
                    equipped with Imaging3 devices.
           For the first time ever, healthcare workers will be
                       able to instantly view 3D,
           high-resolution images of virtually any part of the
                              human body.

         Imaging3 unveiled the Dominion's real-time, 3D imaging
                    to medical imaging professionals
           at 92nd Annual Scientific Assembly and Radiological
                        Society of North America
            Annual Symposium in Chicago on November 28, 2006

          "Real-time 3D, as a medium for display and imaging is
                               here now,
         and its effect on technology over the next few decades,

          especially the medical device market, is ushering in
             a broad advancement in the role of radiology.

           "No longer just a diagnostic tool, real-time three
                          dimensional imaging
         is shifting these devices into a proactive role in the
                           operating room.''

         The Dominion 3D Imaging Unit is a Multi-Function Device

        A diagnostic medical imaging device built with Imaging3
        technology can perform several functions and can
        replace or supplement a number of exiting devices,
        resulting in considerable cost savings for hospitals
        and healthcare centers. These functions include:

             * Perform real time, 3D medical imaging
             * Emulate a CT scanner (at a fraction of the
             capital cost)
             * Perform standard fluoroscopy

        IMGG management believes that this multi-function
        capability will be especially attractive in foreign
        markets, where the cost of a CT scanner is beyond the
        means of most hospitals and healthcare centers. The
        incorporation of all x-ray based technologies into a
        single device capable of producing real-time 3D images
        to be used both in diagnostic and interventional
        surgery applications will change the ways of imaging
        today.

           Having the ability to view images of the patient in
              three dimensions in real time could be the
          difference in providing the correct diagnosis ... the
                    difference between life and death

                                 [Image]
        The Dominion when fully equipped with CT emulation will
        sell for approximately $500,000 and the standard
        Dominion with real-time 3D imaging will sell in the
        $200,000 range.  The Dominion with CT capabilities
        costs about 1/3 the price of a dedicated CT machine but
        with the added advantage that it can be used in areas
        where CT is not currently available such as the
        operating and emergency rooms.  This is due to the
        Dominion’s mobility, small footprint and that it
        provides doctors with superior access to the patient
        than current CT or MRI machines do.  The Dominion does
        far more and for far less.

           Imaging3 competes in the medical diagnostic imaging
         market and this market has never been healthier than it
                               is today.

               This vitality is due primarily to continual
           technological improvements that lead to faster and
                       better-resolution imaging,
           greater patient safety, and the provision of these
                 capabilities to a growing population.

          The result has been a vigorous competition to create
          the most cost-effective diagnostic imaging systems.

                                 [Image]

             According to a Freedonia Group study, the
             medical imaging equipment market in the US
             will register gains of 7.6 percent per year
             through 2008 to $9.5 billion, faster than
             projected growth in national health
             expenditures.

             Growth will be stimulated by an increasing
             incidence of patient procedures involving
             diagnostic imaging, partly the result of an
             aging population and partly reflecting
             advances in noninvasive imaging technology.

             Diagnostic imaging is an evolving part of
             modern medicine and is now entering a new era
             of digital imaging. The field has evolved
             from the early X-rays by Roentgen over 100
             years ago to imaging of organs by
             computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) that are 20 years
             old.
                                ---------

          Medical imaging is used for diagnosis in the leading
         causes of death: heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
         What was once called the "radiology department" is now
              called the "Diagnostic Imaging Department"

                          No Direct Competitors

        At this time, the Company's management is not aware of
        any existing devices in the marketplace that provide
        3D, real-time diagnostic medical imaging, with the
        exception of ultrasound. Ultrasound is a real-time
        tomgraphic imaging modality. Not only does it produce
        real-time tomograms of the position of reflecting
        surfaces (internal organs and structures), but also it
        can be used to produce real-time images of tissue and
        blood motion. However, ultrasound is a low-resolution
        imaging modality that does not produce an image as
        precise and clear as fluoroscopy.

              IMGG's Dominion relies instead on the use of
           fluoroscopy, a high-resolution imaging modality, to
           produce a "live" X-ray image of a living patient in
                                  3D.

                                 [Image]

        The Imaging3 sales effort is a tiered effort that
        consists of: direct mail, broadcast facsimile and
        broadcast email to thousands of potential customers
        throughout the United States to generates leads of
        potential customers desiring to purchase equipment
        either immediately or in the course of one year.

        This lead generation through direct mail and broadcast
        facsimiles and email will continue on a quarterly basis
        with the goal of increasing the total number of  leads
        for the I-3 sales staff. IMGG Management expects that
        the marketing program will also eventually help
        stabilize the amount of refurbished equipment sold on a
        monthly basis, since the carry-over of leads not
        looking for immediate purchase will overlap with the
        immediate sales leads. The greater the number of leads
        generated, whether immediate or long term, the greater
        the opportunity to eventually create a consistent
        number of sales.

                Imaging3 Scheduled to File with the FDA

           Important Milestone Scheduled to Start by Mid-June
                                  2007

        BURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Imaging3(TM), Inc.
        (OTCBB:IMGG - News), developer of a breakthrough
        medical imaging device that produces 3D medical
        diagnostic images of virtually any part of the human
        body in real-time, announced today that it expects to
        file a 510(k) submission with the FDA by June 15th for
        the Dominion(TM) 3D real-time imaging device.

        The FDA 510(k) submission is a device equivalent
        submission comparing the Functionality, Intended Use
        and Energy Transmission with similar devices currently
        on the market. The process can take 6 months or more
        depending upon the complexity of the product and
        quality of the application. "We're extremely excited to
        be ready to file our 510(k) submission with the FDA. We
        hope to obtain FDA approval by year-end, but understand
        the process could continue into 2008. We have generated
        enough data through our initial stages of Beta Testing
        that we are now confident we can proceed with the FDA
        filing," stated Dean Janes, Chairman and CEO.

        Mr. Janes also pointed out that "off-the-shelf"
        components are used, such as the X-Ray source and Image
        Receptor, in the Dominion, and stated further, "While
        it is no guarantee, the fact that we are using 'off-the
        shelf' components known to the FDA, it should help to
        speed the approval process along." Mr. Janes concluded
        his remarks by pointing out that this will be the
        fourth Fluoroscopy based device that he has guided
        through the FDA 510(k) approval process.

<p>Dear Reader,
<p>Sometimes circular logic <i>does</i> make sense.&nbsp; And when said
logic leads to a better mousetrap development in the burgeoning health
care field, it might just be time for investors to take notice.
<p>Today’s featured company, <b><font color="#000099">Imaging3, Inc. (OTCBB:
IMGG)</font></b>, has literally broadened the dimensions of fluoroscopic
technology, developing a device that creates a full spectrum of images
by using a full circle approach to the patient instead of viewing only
part of his or her anatomy.
<p>The result of this ‘circular logic’ is exponential.&nbsp; It’s more
thorough, faster, and is expected to create and allow for procedures currently
impossible with status quo equipment.
<p>Regular <b><font color="#000000">StockUpTicks</font></b> readers are
well aware of our interest in the sure-fire growth of the health care sector.
Now, we’re pleased to bring you a better mousetrap invention that could
potentially redefine one of health care’s most critical and widely used
services.&nbsp; And management indicates that there are&nbsp; currently
<b>NO
DIRECT COMPETITORS</b> in the marketplace providing the same <b>3D, real-time</b>,
<b>high
resolution</b> deliverable.&nbsp; <b>Could this single technology obsolete
what is now a $4 billion medical imaging market?</b>&nbsp; We think it's
worth a close look.&nbsp; Please take a moment to examine this fascinating
company.

The <b><font color="#660000">Dominion</font></b> when fully equipped with
CT emulation will sell for approximately $500,000 and the standard Dominion
with real-time 3D imaging will sell in the $200,000 range.&nbsp; The Dominion
with CT capabilities costs about 1/3 the price of a dedicated CT machine
but with the added advantage that it can be used in areas where CT is not
currently available such as the operating and emergency rooms.&nbsp; This
is due to the Dominion’s mobility, small footprint and that it provides
doctors with superior access to the patient than current CT or MRI machines
do.&nbsp; The Dominion does far more and for far less.

<blockquote>According to a Freedonia Group study, the medical imaging equipment
market in the US will register <u>gains of 7.6 percent per year</u> through
2008 to $9.5 billion, faster than projected growth in national health expenditures.&nbsp;
<p>Growth will be stimulated by an increasing incidence of patient procedures
involving diagnostic imaging, partly the result of an aging population
and partly reflecting advances in noninvasive imaging technology.
<p>Diagnostic imaging is an evolving part of modern medicine and is now
entering a new era of digital imaging. The field has evolved from the early
X-rays by Roentgen over 100 years ago to imaging of organs by computerized
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) <b>that are 20 years
old.&nbsp;</b>

<p><b>At this time,</b> the Company's management is not aware of any existing
devices in the marketplace that provide 3D, real-time diagnostic medical

imaging modality. Not only does it produce real-time tomograms of the position
of reflecting surfaces (internal organs and structures), but also it can
be used to produce real-time images of tissue and blood motion. However,
ultrasound is a <u>low-resolution imaging modality</u> that does not produce
an image as precise and clear as fluoroscopy.&nbsp;
<center>
<p><b><font color="#004A6F">IMGG's</font></b> <b><font color="#660000">Dominion</font></b>
relies instead on the use of fluoroscopy, a high-resolution imaging modality,

<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>BURBANK,
Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Imaging3(TM), Inc. (OTCBB:IMGG - News),</font></font></font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>
developer of a breakthrough medical imaging device that produces 3D medical
diagnostic images of virtually any part of the human body in real-time,
announced today that it expects to file a 510(k) submission with the FDA
by June 15th for the Dominion(TM) 3D real-time imaging device.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>The
FDA 510(k) submission is a device equivalent submission comparing the Functionality,
Intended Use and Energy Transmission with similar devices currently on
the market. The process can take 6 months or more depending upon the complexity
of the product and quality of the application. "We're extremely excited
to be ready to file our 510(k) submission with the FDA. We hope to obtain
FDA approval by year-end, but understand the process could continue into
2008. We have generated enough data through our initial stages of Beta
Testing that we are now confident we can proceed with the FDA filing,"
stated Dean Janes, Chairman and CEO.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Mr.
Janes also pointed out that "off-the-shelf" components are used, such as
the X-Ray source and Image Receptor, in the Dominion, and stated further,
"While it is no guarantee, the fact that we are using 'off-the shelf' components
known to the FDA, it should help to speed the approval process along."
Mr. Janes concluded his remarks by pointing out that this will be the fourth
Fluoroscopy based device that he has guided through the FDA 510(k) approval
process.</font></font></font>
