Dear valued member.
This letter is a part of the official program initiated by the United American Health Department – please, read it to the end if you regularly buy drugs on the Web.
There are so many online drugstores on the Web today – but not all of them are as reliable as one might want them to be. Actually, only a few of them (for example, USDrugs) sell 100% generic meds – so you have to be really careful while choosing where to buy your pills.
Please, don’t be indifferent to the questions of your own health – choose qualitative meds!
--
If you have any more questions please contact to me.
Please include all previous messages in your email's.

Thank you and best regards
