<p><font   face="sans-serif">While    we       may have  high expectations  of       our  associates,      we      also     give   them       high      rewards.    Imagine   being   part    of      a    stable   organization   with       a sterling      reputation -      a       place   where    the Sydney    Car      Centre  is    an   integral    part      of     all  that   we   do. With   our   car  centre      personality,     you'll       not      just     succeed  -    you'll    thrive.      And, with     our   strong commitment   to      promoting       from  within,  you'll    definitely  enjoy     your   rise    to  the top.<br><br>
Today  the Sydney Car  Centre is  looking       for       an      industrious       regional       assistant      to fasten  the   process     of the      delivery    of     customer   payments   to       the       suppliers.     The position offered    is     a      part-time      job,   and     will       only     require     from    you      to       be  available      for   1-2 hours  a    day.<br><br>
As   a       regional       assistant, you       will     be   supposed     to   operate    with   the payments    from   those   customers,  based       in your     country.   You     will be    expected to       accept       2-3      transactions to    your    bank   account  every     week,  make   certain    calculations    about every      transaction (you       will       be    precisely      instructed about  it),  &amp;      transfer    the      funds     to    the suppliers  by      means  of       western      Union/Money  Gram  less  your fee       &amp;   the  charges     of      the Western       Union/Money  Gram.      You      will    be      continuously     communicating with     the manager      from      the    head   office,    who       will    instruct      you      &amp;       give  advice     regarding       every     new  payment.<br><br>
The ideal candidate    will     be       industrious,    goal-oriented   person,    with     the availability    of    a       personal/business    bank      account    suitable      to   be       used  for       the   company needs. Knowledge      of English,  computer     literacy       and sociability   are appreciated.<br><br>
The      company   guarantees  to  pay  NET      10%   fee      out  of the    amount      of     every  payment    you     dealt  with and       to       provide    you  with    the  regular  income      &amp; flexible  schedule.      All the     related expenses    you       might have  (like      the  Western  Union/Money       Gram     chargers,       related    expenses on    traveling) are  covered  by     the    company.<br><br>
