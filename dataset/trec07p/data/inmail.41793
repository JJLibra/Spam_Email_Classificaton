Hello,

Good day, My name is Ocha Spielas, i am working with a bank here in 
Nigeria as a Manager. I am writing you in respect of a foreign 
customer whom made a US$10.5M depository for an investment program 
that has remained dormant for years, up till then i did not heard from 
him not until when i received a news that there was a tsunami disaster 
in Asia that kill thousands of Indonesia’s, include one of our Bank 
customer Mr.Haryanto. Hence, I have decided to contact you due to the 
urgency of this transaction.On personal investigation, I discovered 
that the account holder died on December 26, 2004 in tsunami 
disaster . I made further investigation and discovered that the 
customer died without making a WILL on the depository.
 
 
Right now I am contacting you to help receive and safely secure the 
money over there as his relatives or next of kin, since all my effort 
to locate his family with the telephone number he gave me 
(62853700612) proved nothing, if you are willing to do this deal, you 
should not in any reason tell anybody about this transaction until you 
confirm the money in your account/home, because all we need is to get 
the document of (change of ownership account from the federal high 
court) on your behalf and the money will be release to you as 
beneficiary next of kin to the deceased.
Please kindly furnish me with your information
 
1. Your Full Name/Contact Address
2.Your Personal Telephone Number for effective communication.
3. Your Age/Occupation
 
Please treat this letter with utmost confidentiality and trust. We 
cannot afford to toy with this rare opportunity of a lifetime. It may 
interest you to know that this is no Scam or fairy tale email.
 
If this proposal is acceptable by you, I expect that you will not take 
undue advantage of the trust I Will bestow in you. 
 
Best Regards
 
Ocha Spielas
