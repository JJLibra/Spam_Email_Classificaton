Dear Winner,

LOTTO RHEINLAND-PFALZ WIN NOTIFICATION

We are pleased to inform you of the result of the just concluded
annual final draws of the LOTTO Rheinland-Pfalz Program. LOTTO
Rheinland-Pfalz draws was conducted from an exclusive list of
25,000,000 e-mail addresses of individual and corporate bodies
picked  by an advanced automated random computer ballot search from
the internet as part of our international promotions program which
we conduct every year. Tickets were not sold.

After this automated computer ballot, your e-mail address attached
to serial number 23-2007 drew the lucky numbers 9-29-1-15-4-8
which consequently emerged you as one of first fifty (50) lucky
winners in this category.

You have therefore been approved for a lump sum payout of EUR
1,000,000 (One Million EURO) in cash credited to file LRP/19-DE/9317.
This is from a total cash prize of EUR 50,000,000 (Fifty
million Euro) shared amongst the first fifty (50) lucky winners in
this category.

This year Lottery Program Jackpot is the largest ever for LOTTO
Rheinland-Pfalz. The estimated 50 million Euro jackpot would be the
sixth-biggest in Europe history. The biggest was the 363 million
Euro jackpot that went to two winners in a Febuary 2000 drawing
of The Big Game Mega Millions' predecessor.

insurance. Due to the mix up of some numbers and names, we advice

been processed and your money remitted to you as this is part of
our security protocol to avoid double claiming or unwarranted
