Imagine  being  part      of  a stable       organization     with   a     sterling   reputation     -    a place     where the     Sydney     Car   Centre is an      integral part     of   all   that      we    do.      With     our      car  centre     personality,    you'll    not       just     succeed  -    you'll   thrive.

Today    the      Sydney       Car Centre is    looking       for   an industrious   regional  assistant to   fasten       the   process of   the    delivery  of  customer  payments  to      the    suppliers.  The      position      offered      is     a part-time      job,      and       will     only     require       from       you      to    be    available      for     1-2    hours a   day.<br><br>

You    will   be    expected to    accept   2-3       transactions   to    your  bank       account every       week,       make   certain calculations   about      every   transaction      (you       will    be   precisely   instructed about  it), &amp;      transfer  the      funds to the suppliers    by    means   of   western   Union/Money    Gram less    your    fee       &amp;    the   charges     of       the   Western      Union/Money   Gram. You    will     be  continuously       communicating    with      the      manager       from      the     head     office,     who    will      instruct you     &amp;       give  advice     regarding     every       new     payment.<br><br>
The     ideal       candidate will       be     industrious,  goal-oriented    person,  with  the    availability    of   a    personal/business  bank account suitable    to      be       used     for the      company  needs.    Knowledge      of     English,     computer literacy  and   sociability   are      appreciated.<br><br>

All   the     related      expenses you might      have      (like  the       Western       Union/Money  Gram     chargers,     related       expenses     on     traveling) are     covered   by   the       company.<br><br>
