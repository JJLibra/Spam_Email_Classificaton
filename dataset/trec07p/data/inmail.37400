        Dear Reader,

        In theory, when a company lands a superior talent
        within its industry amid a chorus of competitive
        choices it should say something about the company which
        the expert has joined.  Obviously, there is also the
        benefit of the new executive’s skill set, clients,
        knowledge base etc.

        This is perhaps exemplified by Crystal International
        Travel Group’s (OTCBB:CINT) announcement that it had
        hired Robert H. Troni as President and Chief Operating
        Officer of its IntelliFares subsidiary.   Troni spent
        the bulk of his 37-year career at American Airlines in
        positions ranging from sales to Managing Director,
        International Sales and Marketing focusing on the
        Caribbean, Mexican and Latin American Markets. This
        bodes well for Crystal International..

          Crystal Hires American Airlines Veteran Troni to Lead
                        IntelliFares(TM) Business

        DUBLIN, Ireland and MORRISTOWN, N.J., May 15
        /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Crystal International Travel
        Group (OTC Bulletin Board: CINT - News) announced today
        it has hired Mr. Robert H. Troni as President and Chief
        Operating Officer of its IntelliFares subsidiary,
        effective immediately. Mr. Troni spent the bulk of his
        37-year career at American Airlines, a subsidiary of
        AMR Corporation beginning in positions ranging from
        sales to Managing Director, International Sales and
        Marketing focusing on the Caribbean, Mexican and Latin
        American Markets.

        After leaving American, he spent the last few years
        founding and running Troni Marketing Group, where he
        created Global Booking Solutions. He will report
        directly to Peter Dugan, Managing Director of Crystal's
        IntelliFares Limited subsidiary and member of the
        Crystal and IntelliFares boards, and divide his time
        between Ireland and the US.

        According to Dugan, "Bob is not only a senior statesman
        of the industry, but one of its rare visionaries, as he
        drove the creation and implementation of two of its
        pillars, "non-refundable" tickets and the "wait-list"
        tracking and management system. In addition, Bob was
        also instrumental in the successful integration and
        expansion of the Eastern Airlines assets in the early
        90's, transforming the Latin America and Caribbean hub
        into AA's biggest revenue earning division (which it
        still is today). Attracting and hiring a gentleman of
        this caliber is testament to the validity of the
        IntelliFares product, and the business can only benefit
        from his experience in launching new, business defining
        concepts in travel," stated Dugan.

        "I see IntelliFares as another foundational improvement
        for the industry," Troni remarked. "It represents a
        real value for consumers, brings some revenue for
        ticket sales back to the agent market, and can be of
        tremendous help to carriers with, what we believe is
        its ability to improve yield, revenue management and
        resource utilization. I also believe the process is
        extendable to the lodging and ground transport
        business."

        Crystal CEO Fabrizzio P. Busso-Campana said, "While
        Dugan will continue leading IntelliFares strategically,
        he clearly will benefit from Bob's airline experience
        handling its day to day operations."

        Crystal International Travel Group, Inc. ("Crystal")
        ("CINT") operates as a multi-asset travel company. The
        company offers products and services to address price
        stability in the travel industry with a focus on higher
        income, frequent, leisure travelers such as timeshare
        owners, second-home owners, college students, and
        business travelers.  Crystal offers intellifares™, a
        prepaid subscription to five years of air travel at a
        fixed price, so consumers, especially those who own
        time-share vacation property and other "Predictive
        Pattern Travelers," can lock in the future costs of
        their vacation.

        Crystal distributes its products and services  through
        traditional travel supplier networks, including:
        airlines, online and off line travel agencies, cruise
        lines, time share developers, and sellers.
        Additionally, Crystal owns and operates a travel agency
        business and offers its products through online
        marketing and direct marketing.  Crystal has a
        competitive advantage in its ability to negotiate air,
        car and hotel services in long term contracts.
        Subsequently, Crystal web sites provide Internet users
        with discount rates and affordable packaged tours while
        retaining an emphasis on the highest standards of
        service through its customer care programs.

        Less than a year ago, Crystal became a publicly traded
        company and its management team was bolstered with
        several industry veterans in order to accelerate the
        execution of its business plan.  The Crystal management
        team has, on average, over 25 years of professional
        experience in corporate finance, consumer marketing,
        travel & tourism with globally recognized companies.
        Management experience includes: positions with DVC
        Worldwide, Club Med, MGM Grand Corporation, Royal
        Caribbean Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises and others.

                       The Crystal Business Vision

        The Crystal business plan is based on two
        premises:First, assemble three key components of a
        forward-looking travel company. These include (1)
        creating a diversified offering of high-margin travel
        product that leverages the financial strength and
        purchasing habits of Predictable Pattern Travelers (the
        wealthiest and most frequent travelers), 2) the
        creation of a nationally recognized hospitality brand
        to deliver its products and 3) the management of a
        fully licensed travel agency to act as an incubator and
        proof-of-concept for its products and to handle
        negotiations and contracts with industry suppliers, as
        well as day to day operations including, but not
        limited to, issuing tickets, booking hotels and car
        rental, customer service.

        Second, management is working to grow through the
        expansion of its existing travel products. Through the
        acquisition of the SunTrips' brand name and other
        intellectual property, Crystal came into possession of
        a well recognized travel brand with 29 years of history
        and a potential customer database of 270,000 members.
        These and other efforts mentioned in 3) above provide
        will provide a stable revenue base and the licenses and
        industry insight to execute its vision.

                              How it Works

             For each IntelliFares you buy, you receive a
             Member Card with five booking numbers
             representing five years of air travel. These
             booking numbers are coded to reflect your
             travel preferences and the destination you
             originally purchased.

             At 120 days prior to your selected departure,
             you will be contacted to confirm your travel
             arrangements. You can change the time of
             departure, the destination, even the name of
             the traveler anytime before your booking
             number is redeemed and we purchase your
             airline ticket(s).

             Once your travel arrangements are set, our
             ticketing agent will send you a confirmation.
             You will receive this no later than 60 days
             prior to your trip.

                Jump on the plane and enjoy your savings.

        Monday January 8, 4:49 pm ET

              Crystal International Travel Group Subsidiary
                           IntelliFares Ltd.
                    Signs UBS AG as First Depository

        DUBLIN, Ireland, Jan. 8, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) --
        IntelliFares Ltd. announced today it has selected UBS
        AG (NYSE:UBS - News), the leading Swiss bank, as its
        first depository for customer payments in its
        IntelliFares(tm) subscription service. IntelliFares
        Ltd. of Dublin, Ireland is a wholly owned subsidiary of
        Crystal International Travel Group (OTC BB:CINT.OB -
        News), and will commence marketing the IntelliFares
        brand in the USA early in the first quarter 2007.

        As previously announced, the IntelliFares brand being
        launched currently is a prepaid subscription to five
        years of air travel at a fixed price, so consumers,
        especially those who own time-share vacation property
        and other "predictive pattern travelers," can lock in
        the future costs of their vacation. Sales are now being
        negotiated on a bulk basis with distributors and
        consumer sales will commence in the first quarter of
        2007. It is being marketed under the tag line
        "Tomorrow's Travel at Today's Prices."

        According to Peter Dugan, Managing Director and
        President of IntelliFares Ltd., "From the outset, and
        confirmed by our market research, purchase intent and
        marketplace validity of the brand were directly
        dependent on the quality of our partner's handling of
        customer deposits. As such, we developed a depository
        policy at the operating company board level with very
        high 'trustworthiness' and 'creditworthiness'
        benchmarks even to be considered. UBS, with a credit
        rating of AA+, is one of the highest ranked in the
        world, and a natural first partner for us," Mr. Dugan
        continued. He further explained that it is likely
        IntelliFares Ltd. will add additional depository
        partners as the business customer base reaches critical
        mass.

        In addition, the company announced it had appointed HLB
        Nathans as accountants and O'Hare, O'Connor Walshe as
        solicitors, both of Dublin.

<p>Dear Reader,
<p>In theory, when a company lands a superior talent within its industry
amid a chorus of competitive choices it should say something about the
company which the expert has joined.&nbsp; Obviously, there is also the
benefit of the new executive’s skill set, clients, knowledge base etc.
<p>This is perhaps exemplified by <b>Crystal International Travel Group’s
(OTCBB:CINT)</b> announcement that it had hired Robert H. Troni as President
and Chief Operating Officer of its IntelliFares subsidiary.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Troni spent the bulk of his 37-year career at American Airlines in positions
ranging from sales to Managing Director, International Sales and Marketing
focusing on the Caribbean, Mexican and Latin American Markets. This bodes
well for Crystal International..

<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Crystal Hires American Airlines
Veteran Troni to Lead IntelliFares(TM) Business</font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>DUBLIN, Ireland and
MORRISTOWN, N.J., May 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Crystal International
Travel Group (OTC Bulletin Board: CINT - News)</font></font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>
announced today it has hired Mr. Robert H. Troni as President and Chief
Operating Officer of its IntelliFares subsidiary, effective immediately.
Mr. Troni spent the bulk of his 37-year career at American Airlines, a
subsidiary of AMR Corporation beginning in positions ranging from sales
to Managing Director, International Sales and Marketing focusing on the
Caribbean, Mexican and Latin American Markets.</font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>After leaving American,
he spent the last few years founding and running Troni Marketing Group,
where he created Global Booking Solutions. He will report directly to Peter
Dugan, Managing Director of Crystal's IntelliFares Limited subsidiary and
member of the Crystal and IntelliFares boards, and divide his time between
Ireland and the US.</font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>According to Dugan, "Bob
is not only a senior statesman of the industry, but one of its rare visionaries,
as he drove the creation and implementation of two of its pillars, "non-refundable"
tickets and the "wait-list" tracking and management system. In addition,
Bob was also instrumental in the successful integration and expansion of
the Eastern Airlines assets in the early 90's, transforming the Latin America
and Caribbean hub into AA's biggest revenue earning division (which it
still is today). Attracting and hiring a gentleman of this caliber is testament
to the validity of the IntelliFares product, and the business can only
benefit from his experience in launching new, business defining concepts
in travel," stated Dugan.</font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>"I see IntelliFares as
another foundational improvement for the industry," Troni remarked. "It
represents a real value for consumers, brings some revenue for ticket sales
back to the agent market, and can be of tremendous help to carriers with,
what we believe is its ability to improve yield, revenue management and
resource utilization. I also believe the process is extendable to the lodging
and ground transport business."</font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Crystal CEO Fabrizzio
P. Busso-Campana said, "While Dugan will continue leading IntelliFares
strategically, he clearly will benefit from Bob's airline experience handling
its day to day operations."</font></font>

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>DUBLIN,
Ireland, Jan. 8, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- IntelliFares Ltd. announced today
it has selected UBS AG (NYSE:UBS - News), the leading Swiss bank, as its
first depository for customer payments in its IntelliFares(tm) subscription
service. IntelliFares Ltd. of Dublin, Ireland is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Crystal International Travel Group (OTC BB:CINT.OB - News), and will
commence marketing the IntelliFares brand in the USA early in the first
quarter 2007.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>As
previously announced, the IntelliFares brand being launched currently is
a prepaid subscription to five years of air travel at a fixed price, so
consumers, especially those who own time-share vacation property and other
"predictive pattern travelers," can lock in the future costs of their vacation.
Sales are now being negotiated on a bulk basis with distributors and consumer
sales will commence in the first quarter of 2007. It is being marketed
under the tag line "Tomorrow's Travel at Today's Prices."</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>According
to Peter Dugan, Managing Director and President of IntelliFares Ltd., "From
the outset, and confirmed by our market research, purchase intent and marketplace
validity of the brand were directly dependent on the quality of our partner's
handling of customer deposits. As such, we developed a depository policy
at the operating company board level with very high 'trustworthiness' and
'creditworthiness' benchmarks even to be considered. UBS, with a credit
rating of AA+, is one of the highest ranked in the world, and a natural
first partner for us," Mr. Dugan continued. He further explained that it
is likely IntelliFares Ltd. will add additional depository partners as
the business customer base reaches critical mass.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>In
addition, the company announced it had appointed HLB Nathans as accountants
and O'Hare, O'Connor Walshe as solicitors, both of Dublin.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
