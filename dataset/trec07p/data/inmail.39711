 Viburnum   Viburnum  is a genus of about 150 175 species of shrubs or  in a few
species  small trees that were previously included in the family Caprifoliaceae.
Genetic tests by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group showed however that they are
correctly classified in the family Adoxaceae.

They are native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species
extending into tropical montane regions in South America and southeast Asia. In
Africa, the genus is confined to the Atlas Mountains.

The leaves are opposite, simple, and entire, toothed or lobed  cool temperate
species are deciduous, while most of the warm temperate species are evergreen.
Some species are densely hairy on the shoots and leaves, with star shaped hairs.

The flowers are produced in corymbs 5 15 cm across, each flower white to cream
or pink, small, 3 5 mm across, with five petals, strongly fragrant in some
species. The gynoecium has 3 connate carpels with the nectary on top of the
gynoecium. Some species also have a fringe of large, showy sterile flowers round
the perimeter of the corymb to act as a pollinator target.

The fruit is a spherical, oval or somewhat flattened drupe, red to purple, blue,
or black, and containing a single seed  they are eaten by birds and other
wildlife, and some are edible for humans  though many others are mildly
poisonous to people . The leaves are sometimes eaten by the larvae of some
Lepidoptera species   see list of Lepidoptera which feed on Viburnum.

Species About 150 species are known, including the following

Cultivation and uses Many species of viburnum have become popular as garden or
landscape plants because of their showy flowers and berries and generally good
autumn colour. Some popular species, hybrids, and cultivars include 
  The hybrid Viburnum    bodnantense  V. farreri    V. grandiflorum  is
  particularly popular for its strongly scented pink flowers on the leafless
  deciduous shoots in mid to late winter.
  Viburnum    burkwoodii  V. carlesii    V. utile 
  Viburnum    carlcephallum  V. carlesii    V. macrocephalum 
  Viburnum carlesii has flowers that look somewhat like snowballs, excellent
  fragrance, dense structure, and reddish leaves in autumn.
  Viburnum davidii is an evergreen species from China with blue fruit.
  Viburnum dentatum has flat topped flowers, bluish fruit, and reddish leaves in
  autumn. It is somewhat salt tolerant. The cultivar  Blue Muffin  is more
  compact than the species and has fruit that are a deeper blue than the
  species.

/Youngstown State University/, founded in 1908, is an accred

ited university
located in Youngstown, Ohio. As of 2005, there were 13,101 students and a 

student/
faculty ratio of
19/1. Records show that 11,803 of the students are undergraduate

s. Beyond its
      current student body, YSU claims more than 77,000 alumni.

History The

 university/s origins trace back to 1908, when the local branch of
the YMCA established a 

school of law within the Youngstown Association School.
In 1921, the school became known a

s the Youngstown Institute of Technology and
offered its first evening courses. In 1928, a

 year after establishing the
College of Arts and Sciences, the institute once again change

d its name to
Youngstown College. In 1955, Youngstown College was renamed as Youngstown
Un

iversity, an indication of the school/s broadening curriculum.

On September 1, 1967, afte

r becoming a public institution, Youngstown University
became officially known as Youngsto

wn State University. The following spring,
YSU opened a Graduate School and College of App

lied Science and Technology/ and
in 1974, the College of Fine and Performing Arts was esta

blished.

Statistics

As of fall 2006, the student body totaled 13,183, 1,192 of whom are 

graduate
students. YSU has approximately 2,100 full and part/time employees, and 426 full/


time faculty with 543 part/time faculty. One hundred and sixty/five faculty
members boast

 full/professor rank with 79/ of the instructors holding Ph. D/s or
terminal degrees. The 

university also boasts a student to faculty ratio of 19/1.

Tuition for students living in

 Ohio is $6,333 plus fees, $8,355 plus fees for
students coming from the regional service 

area, and $11,541 for students from
out of state. Room and board costs an additional $6,28

0. YSU will often note
that these tuitions are the lowest of any public university in Ohio

. YSU is
primarily a commuter school, with most students living at home or in residence
of

f campus, but approximately 1,000 students live in residence halls on campus.
Another 400 

live in the University Courtyard apartment complexes just off of
campus. About 13/ of the 

student body are international students from 55
countries.

YSU is currently trying to get

 more students to live on campus, with initiatives
such as mandatory on/campus housing for

 students in the Leslie Cochran
University Scholars program. One of the goals for the univ

ersity/s centennial in
2008 is to have 20 percent of the student body living on campus.

T

here are over 500,000 volumes at the campus/ Maag Library, and participation in
the OhioLI

NK program gives access to the collections of 84 other Ohio
institutions. The Wilcox Curri

culum Resource Center in Beeghly Hall complements
the resources available at Maag.

YSU is

 participating in the Early College program, through which students from
the Youngstown Ci

ty School District can take courses for college credit while in
high school. The program i

s in its second year, and has approximately 150 ninth
and tenth graders enrolled.

Campus



YSU lies on a 140 acre campus just north of downtown Youngstown. Although it is
not locat

ed near any outstanding geographical features, that has not stopped
Youngstown State/s cam

pus from being noted for its landscaping, which is
dissimilar from that of many other urba

n universities. YSU/s geographical center
has a park/like atmosphere, featuring a rather/h

illy terrain and a variety of
trees and plant life, as well as tables and chairs that surr

ound a campus
fountain.

Most buildings on campus have been built within the last half/cen

tury, making
them newer than most buildings in downtown Youngstown, where most buildings w

ere
constructed before the Great Depression.

Buildings

Jones Hall, often the building th

at welcomes people coming onto the YSU campus,
is also one of the campus/s oldest building

s, having been built in 1931, when
YSU was known as Youngstown College. Its history as the

 /main building/ of the
campus continues today, as it is perhaps the best/known and most p

hotographed
building of the whole campus. Today, it hosts many of the administrative
offic

es.

The Rayen College of Engineering and Technology is housed in Moser Hall,
completed in

 1967. The university/s geological and environmental sciences
department shares the space,

 and also sponsor the Clarence R. Smith Mineral
Museum.

The newest addition to YSU is the

 Andrews Wellness and Recreation Center.
Completed in time for the fall 2005 semester, the

 Andrews Center gave YSU a
complete gym facility, as well as a climbing wall and racquetba

ll courts.

Bliss Hall, completed in 1977 and featuring two auditoriums, is the home of th

e
College of Fine and Performing Arts. Next door to Bliss is the McDonough Museum
of Art,
