<P align=3Dleft>Dear Memo,=20
<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was examining the astrological ene=
rgies on June 22nd, 2007&nbsp;and how they will affect us, and literally, li=
ke a bolt from the blue, I received a vision so vivid, it was like dreaming =
with my eyes wide open.</P>
<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signs of incredible success were=
 unmistakable, but I also saw negative energies, and I'm worried that they m=
ight keep you from taking advantage of the incredibly lucky forces in your f=
avor. So let me get right to your reading, so I can explain everything to yo=
u.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>I see the four Mystical Milestones of<BR></B><B>the anc=
ient "Passageway of Power" in your destiny...</B></P>
<P style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, Courier, mono" align=

<TD vAlign=3Dtop align=3Dleft colSpan=3D3 height=3D103>
<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this reading, I will explain what=
 I saw and what it could mean for you...</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>A person is walking down a long stone corridor=
. A beam of light comes from a distant window...just enough to softly illumi=
nate magnificent tapestries lining the walls. Up ahead, a dark figure, a Gui=
de, slowly and gently motions the individual to come forward. </I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, I want you to envision yourself as this per=
son...

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>As you progress further along the passageway, =
a large oak door appears to one side. Etched in stone on the wall just besid=
e the door are odd-looking symbols from a long-lost alphabet.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>You try to push the bronze latch on the handle=
, but it is locked. Your Guide extends an open hand to you. In it is a glowi=
ng, Golden Key, shining brightly in the dark, and as you will see, this Key =
has special, magical powers...</I>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>What is extraordinary about this vision?</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, I realized that this was no ordinary corrid=
or and that <U>this vision was all about discovering the incredible powers y=
ou carry within you and the astonishing possibilities&nbsp;June 22nd, 2007&n=
bsp;holds for your Destiny</U>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, the stone floor, tapestries, bronze deta=
il and especially the strange signs on the wall were my tip that you were ro=
aming the inner pathways of the sacred Runic Passageway of Power. Because I =
recognized that the symbols were in fact Runes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nordic Dynasties of the medieval period built=
 a prosperous, thriving civilization, rich with lore, including the magical =
Runes, symbols derived from the Romans and used extensively by the Nordic Pe=
oples to attract good fortune and ward off bad luck.</P>
<P>The Runes etched into the stone wall included:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nordic warriors used the runes to ensure victory =
in battle. Along with the Runes, astrology also played an important role in =
Nordic history and legend. In the year 1030 A.D., the Patron Saint of Norway=
, King Olaf, charged into battle just as the Sun went into a total eclipse, =
and ultimately Norway's independence was won.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, just as the great Nordic Kings looked to th=
e stars and the Runes for the key to their ultimate destiny, the forces favo=
ring you on June 22nd, 2007 will bring you the greatest power and benefits f=
rom the Four Mystical Milestones of the ancient "Passageway of Power"...Mone=
y, Love, Health, and Joy.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>A whole new world of wealth and power<BR>is opening up =
for you</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because I want you to be able to take full ad=
vantage of every opportunity that will come to you, I want to give you this =
free gift:</P>
<P><IMG height=3D49 alt=3D"" src=3D"http://www2.myhealthwealthandhappiness.c=

iness.com/goldenkey/goldenkeybj.jpg" width=3D539 border=3D0></P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>THIS IS THE KEY -- THAT WILL UNLOCK YOUR FUTURE</B></P>=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This specially energized key will concentrate and=
 focus the positive energy that is now building around you. (Caution: You ma=
y feel a tingle when wearing it.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look closely at it, you will see the deepl=
y inscribed Runes. I had the key plated for you in Gold to protect its power=
 and purity. (Gold, one of the basic elements, cannot be corroded or corrupt=
ed in any way by anything.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you receive this key, I want you to we=
ar it or keep it close to you 24 hours a day.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Open the door, Memo, to a new world <BR>of riches, happ=
iness, health and success!</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, in the vision you and your Guide were s=
tanding before a door. The crucial thing for you to keep in mind is that eve=
ry door represents an amazing opportunity for you to gain wealth, happiness,=
 health and success.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>You insert the Golden Key in the great oaken d=
oor. The tumblers of the lock give way, with a sound like coins shaking in a=
 can. You open the door to an enormous chamber filled with sunlight. All aro=
und the room are rare, valuable antiques, jewelry, and chests filled with go=
lden coins and treasure.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Some of the items glimmer and gleam, while oth=
ers have become tarnished, dull and dusty.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Drawn to the collection of goods in one corner=
 of the room, you recognize certain items. To your astonishment, you find a =
favorite toy you played with as a child. On a set of shelves nearby is every=
 gift you have ever given, including those you later regretted.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>In one chest is all the money you have ever sp=
ent...in another all that you have ever lost through waste, bad investments,=
 or impulsive spending. The coins and bills in these chests are tarnished an=
d faded but still good.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Further ahead, you come upon an array of spark=
ling, brand new items, jewelry and watches, treasure chests filled with gold=
, stacks of cash, amounting to millions upon millions of dollars.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>As you browse, the items get bigger, as does t=
he room...soon you see beautiful, luxurious furniture, an enormous yacht...a=
nd just outside the window, a huge mansion on a hill, with a glimmering pond=
 before it.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>A car pulls up in front of the mansion. It is =
a silver Jaguar with the license plate  8 8 72 -- (your birthday, Memo!). Be=
autifully-dressed people climb out of the car, and you recognize them too. T=
hey are the members of your family.</I></P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Memo, you can live like a King!</B>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not know this, Memo, but when the Great K=
ings of the medieval Nordic Dynasty passed on, they were buried with all the=
ir riches, property, even medicine and food -- everything they would need to=
 begin a new life with their health, youthful energy and most precious posse=
ssions restored to them. And their dearest loved ones would ultimately join =
them in this new, higher state of existence: A Paradise of Riches, Love, and=
 Renewed Health.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't believe what a perfect sign this is! For,=
 like the greatest Kings of the Nordic Dynasties, you too are about to begin=
 a whole new life. And as you discover the wealth of powers you possess with=
 you, your entire world will become new to you, and you will want for nothin=
g! Even your loved ones will benefit from the transformation you are about t=
o have.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you see? This is exactly what I am trying t=
o tell you! You can live like a king! And I'm going to show you exactly how =
you can make this reality come true in your life!</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Together, we can break through the veil<BR>concealing t=
he true causes of your problems!</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your journey through the Passageway of Power, =
your rediscovery of all your property represents the past, present and futur=
e of your life -- the gains, losses, your successes and the failures, your s=
trengths and weaknesses ... and the possibility of a future filled with rich=
es, love and unimaginable happiness!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even those items that have been lost forever are =
still invaluable...because each one represents an experience that offers you=
 a precious nugget of wisdom. It's human nature to be afraid to look at our =
losses, but to do so is to turn your back on the possibilities of gaining tr=
easures beyond your wildest dreams!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I was talking about at the very begi=
nning of this letter -- the power of negative energy to surround you and cut=
 you off from your best opportunities to succeed and find the money, love an=
d dazzling health!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Memo, negativity and failure affect ever=
yone. But the most successful people take their setbacks in stride. They don=
't ignore them...instead they learn from them and focus as much of their tim=
e, effort and talents on their greatest strengths.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can do the same! I'll show you how to tur=
n negatives into positives and positives into a constantly multiplying windf=
all of prosperity!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Memo, starting June 22nd, 2007&nbsp;you will h=
ave an extraordinary opportunity to absolutely neutralize the negative energ=
ies around you and take control of your own destiny.</B></P>

of the Passageway of Power into your life in a real, concrete and lasting wa=
y. I'm going to give you everything you need in:</P>

ersonal Power that has given you the determination to make it through the to=
ugh times!</P>
