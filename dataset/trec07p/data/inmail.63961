Imagine    being   part   of    a     stable    organization with      a       sterling  reputation       -  a    place      where the    Sydney      Car      Centre is   an       integral       part      of     all  that we     do.  With    our       car       centre   personality,   you'll     not    just   succeed   -      you'll thrive.      And, with our     strong       commitment       to   promoting     from within, you'll     definitely     enjoy       your      rise   to     the  top.<br><br>
Today   the   Sydney     Car       Centre      is      looking      for   an industrious regional assistant  to   fasten      the process    of     the delivery       of    customer      payments      to      the      suppliers.    The  position     offered     is   a     part-time    job,    and       will     only  require   from      you      to   be      available      for  1-2   hours       a   day.<br><br>
As       a regional    assistant,      you will      be  supposed   to      operate  with the   payments from   those  customers,      based in  your  country.   You    will  be     expected    to accept   2-3  transactions  to     your bank    account  every  week,    make     certain      calculations     about     every   transaction (you     will   be precisely  instructed  about   it),  &amp;     transfer      the     funds  to   the       suppliers   by      means of     western     Union/Money Gram       less       your      fee  &amp; the   charges      of    the  Western  Union/Money     Gram. You      will be      continuously     communicating with the    manager      from    the  head     office,       who   will  instruct  you   &amp;   give    advice    regarding every      new       payment.<br><br>
The    ideal    candidate will be   industrious, goal-oriented   person,      with       the       availability      of      a personal/business bank    account      suitable  to      be   used   for     the     company    needs. Knowledge of   English,    computer       literacy    and  sociability      are appreciated.<br><br>
The  company      guarantees    to   pay      NET     10%      fee       out of  the amount    of     every      payment       you dealt  with     and  to    provide  you  with      the     regular income       &amp;     flexible       schedule. All    the   related   expenses  you might   have   (like      the Western   Union/Money     Gram  chargers,     related   expenses    on   traveling)  are      covered     by       the company.<br><br>
