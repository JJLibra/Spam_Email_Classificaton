Dear valued member.
We are writing to inform you about the result of the recent research concerning the quality of the drugs sold on the Internet.
This letter is NOT a piece of ad – we just want you to know that more 80% of the drugs you purchase on the Internet come from underground factories in southern Asia – so, apparently, no one can say that they are totally safe. The only drugstore that has managed to prove the quality of its meds so far is USDrugs.
Hope that you’ve found the information provided in the letter useful.
