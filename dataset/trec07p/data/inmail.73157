        Editors Note:

        Has a 4th of July ever meant more than it does today?

        The Land of the Free, the Home of the Brave. We utter
        these phrases with a complacency and comfort akin to
        the faith that each breath we draw will indeed contain
        the requisite oxygen to sustain life. For years, we
        ushered in our nation's birthday with hot dogs, beer,
        and fireworks, somehow removed from the sacrifices of
        the valiant souls who gave life to this new nation.

        But September 11 and a long war keeps modern realities
        ringing in  the ear of we the people, and while today
        the StockUpTicks team again is fortunate to share the
        time off with friends and family, we do so with an
        appreciation of our blessed way of life. Somewhere a
        soldier sits against a dusty wall while we throw back
        hot dogs and Belgian beers.

        Recently, I had the opportunity to visit my
        grandfather's village in Eastern Europe where a society
        exists between wars and armed conflicts the way we ride
        the tide of bull and bear markets. At one point, I
        found myself looking over a serene blue-green hillside
        where my grandfather once stood, pondering the
        "what-if" consequences of my existence had my father's
        father not passed through Ellis Island so many years
        ago. Tomorrow, my fellow editor embarks for Ireland for
        the first time, taking his young son to the land of his
        ancestors as well. I trust that the perspective of
        their journey will invoke an even greater appreciation
        for this country and the lives that were our
        birthright. Perhaps this song expresses that sentiment
        best.

        We are indeed the Land of the Free, the Home of the
        Brave, and as cliche' as it may sound, The Greatest
        Nation on Earth, perhaps the greatest civilization of
        all time, warts and all.

        Today, with a depth of sincerity StockUpTicks pays
        tribute to the fathers and the keepers of this great
        country with the most fitting homage we can provide, a
        simple and heartfelt, "Thank you."

        Be well these days.
