 or elk with a bow.]] hunting, tacuinum sanitatis casanatensis  XIV century ]]
  Hunting  is the practice of pursuing animals for food, recreation, trade or
 for their products. In modern use, the term refers to regulated and legal
 hunting, as distinguished from poaching, which is the killing, trapping or
 capture of animals contrary to law. Hunted animals are referred to as game
 animals, and are usually large mammals or migratory birds.

By definition, hunting strictly speaking, excludes the killing   though similar
techniques may be used   of individual protected animals, such as bears which
have become dangerous to humans, as well as the killing of non game animals,
domestic animals, or vermin as a means of pest control. Hunting can be a
component of modern wildlife management, for example to help maintain a
population of healthy animals within an environment s ecological carrying
capacity. ref   ref  In the United States, wildlife managers are frequently part
of hunting regulatory and licensing bodies, where they help to set rules on the
number, manner and conditions in which game may be selected for culling.

The pursuit, capture and release, or capture to eat of fish is called fishing,
which is not commonly categorized as a kind of hunting, although many hunters
may also fish. Trapping is also usually considered a separate activity. Neither
is it considered hunting to pursue animals without intent to take them, as in
wildlife photography or birdwatching. The practice of hunting for plants or
mushrooms is a colloquial term for gathering.

History Ancient roots as huntress.]]

Hunting has an extremely long history and may well predate the rise of species
[[Human evolution/Homo sapiens]]. While our earliest primate ancestors were
probably insectivores there is evidence that we have used larger animals for
subsistence for up to 1.8 million years and that hunting may have been one of
the multiple environmental factors leading to replacement of holocene megafauna
by smaller herbivores. ref   cite journal

With the establishment of language and culture hunting became a theme of stories
and myths, as well as proverbs, aphorisms, adages and metaphors which continue
even today.

Many species of animals have been hunted and caribou wild reindeer  may well be
the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological
literature on hunting.  ref name Burch  In North America and Eurasia the species
has long been an important resource  in many areas the most important resource  
for peoples inhabiting the northern boreal forest and tundra regions. Known
human dependence on caribou wild reindeer has a long history, beginning in the
Middle Pleistocene  Banfield 1961 170  Kurt  n 1968 170  and continuing to the
present....The caribou wild reindeer is thus an animal that has been a major
resource for humans throughout a tremendous geographic area and across a time
span of tens of thousands of years.  Ernest S. Burch, Jr. [http   links.jstor.org sici?sici 0002

Vol. 37, No. 3  Jul., 1972 , pp. 339 368.  ref 

Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread, hunting was usually a
significant contributor to the human food supply, even after the development of
agriculture. The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein
 literally  the most important   food, bone for implements, sinew for cordage,
fur and feathers for ornament, with rawhide and leather also used in clothing
and shelter. The earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks, spears, the
atlatl, bow and arrows.

On Ancient reliefs, especially from Mesopotamia, kings are often depicted as
hunters on big game such as lions, specially from a war chariot, another virile
status symbol  perhaps the archetype is the legendary biblical Nimrod  king .
The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is
represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos, or lunar goddesses of
classical antiquity, Greek </STYLE>
