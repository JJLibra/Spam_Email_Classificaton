<p><b><i>&ldquo;Reboot Your System&rdquo;</i></b></p>
<p>You may be thinking that due to this little &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; from stocks we&rsquo;ve been taking at <em>Trending123</em>, you can exist on auto-pilot.</p>
<a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK--8FP165-8FP165-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca"><img align="right" src="http://images.investorplace.com/e_images/jlhs/easier_than_123.gif" width="120" height="80" border="0" style="margin-left:8px;"></a>
<p>Well I don&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>
<p>When you aren&rsquo;t trading stocks, you should actively be trying to better yourself as an investor.&nbsp;  That way when it comes time to buy stocks, you are amply prepared and confident in your trades.</p>
<p>Otherwise it&rsquo;s kind of like when you were a kid coming off of summer break.&nbsp;  School work is familiar but it takes you awhile to remember the process and fully be back in the swing of things.</p>
<p>And when it comes to investing, the further you get behind, the less profits you will end up making, while those that have kept their &ldquo;game face&rdquo; on will whiz right past you &mdash; collecting their profits (and yours!) along the way.</p>

<p><b>The Power of 3</b></p>
<p>Remember &mdash; there are 3 indicators that we use to identify where the market or a particular stock is headed.&nbsp;  All three are key to understanding what is happening and even more important, what will happen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review them now.</p>
<p><b>Aroon:</b></p>
<p>How do you tell that a new trend in a certain stock or index has begun?&nbsp;  Look no further than the Aroon indicator.</p>
<p>The Aroon system uses two lines to plot market trends: an &ldquo;Aroon up&rdquo; line and an &ldquo;Aroon down&rdquo; line.&nbsp;  The Aroon-up line measures how long it has been since the highest closing price, and the Aroon-down line measures how long it&rsquo;s been since the lowest closing price.&nbsp;  When the Aroon-up line is going up and crosses the Aroon-down line as it is going down, that&rsquo;s a good indication that the trend is becoming bullish.&nbsp;  When the opposite happens&mdash;that is, the Aroon-down line is going up and crosses the Aroon-up line as it goes down&mdash;that may mean the trend is becoming bearish.</p>
<p><b>PPO:</b></p>
<p>PPO stands for percentage price oscillator.&nbsp;  The PPO expresses the difference between a shorter-term moving average and a longer-term moving average as a percentage.&nbsp;  For instance, a PPO of +5% means that the shorter-term moving average is 5% higher than the longer-term moving average.&nbsp;  A PPO of -5% means that the shorter-term moving average is 5% lower than the longer-term moving average.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s expressed as a percentage instead of as an absolute value, the PPO is very reliable.&nbsp;  And that&rsquo;s why we can use it to help identify trend reversals: When the PPO rises above zero, it&rsquo;s bullish, and when it falls below zero, it&rsquo;s bearish.</p>
<p><b>Williams %Range:</b></p>
<p>Larry Williams, its developer, used a scale of 0% to 100% to show the relationship of the current closing price relative to the range of prices from the highest to the lowest over a certain period of time.&nbsp;  As the closing price approaches the high, the Williams %R will approach 0%.&nbsp;  And as the closing price approaches the low, the Williams %R will approach 100%.</p>
<p>The Williams %R gives us an easy-to-read signal for when the trend might be turning bullish or bearish.&nbsp;  If the Williams %R rises above the 50% line, it&rsquo;s bullish.&nbsp;  If it falls below the 50% line, it&rsquo;s bearish.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve got three tools that together allow you to identify what I call 1-2-3 bullish and bearish trend reversals.&nbsp;  And as <em>Trending123</em> subscribers have seen again and again, that&rsquo;s where the best profits are.</p>

<p><b>A Refresher Course</b></p>
<p>Let me remind you what pattern we are in right now and why it can drive us insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the RST, or Reverse Symmetrical Triangle.&nbsp;  Or some of you may know it under my nickname for it: the Nut Hut.</p>
<p>I call it this because it can drive any investor nuts!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">The pattern looks like this:</p>
<img src="http://images.investorplace.com/e_images/jlhs/20070612/megaphone.jpg" width="290" height="200" alt="Megaphone">
<p>And as you can see, it creates a &ldquo;megaphone&rdquo; formation.&nbsp;  This is considered a bearish signal, which indicates that indicating that the current uptrend may reverse to form a new downtrend.</p>
<p>That is where we&rsquo;re at.&nbsp;  That is where we have been for several weeks now.</p>
<p>And though it seems as though we will continue a never-ending ride upwards &mdash; don&rsquo;t let the talking heads fool you &mdash; this pattern is DESTINED to come down.</p>
<p>I wish I could pinpoint when it will begin its descent.&nbsp;  I wish I could prove this to all of you non-believers.&nbsp;  But I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I can only remind you that these charts that have been used for over a century, have been followed for a reason: THEY WORK.&nbsp;  And they don&rsquo;t lie!</p>

<p>As I said, there&rsquo;s no way to tell you exactly when the market will tip over and barrel down but when it does come, I&rsquo;ll be right there,leading the charge!&nbsp;  Leading you and my <em>Trending123</em> subscribers towards the stocks that you can count on for profits&mdash;correction be darned!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been forewarned.&nbsp;  Now take the next sensible step &mdash; arm yourself with knowledge!</p>

<p>P.S. Each pattern has a varying degree of likelihood that it will play out the way the technician thinks it will.&nbsp;  The RST has a 98% probability of unfolding the way I say it will.&nbsp;  98%!&nbsp;  When was the last time you saw odds like that?&nbsp;  <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK--8FP165-8FP165-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca">Join me at <em>Trending123</em> and let&rsquo;s get ready to profit together.</a></p>
