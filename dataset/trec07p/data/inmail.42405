 Camping  is an outdoor recreational activity, in which the campers get away
from civilization and enjoy nature while spending one or more nights at a
campsite. They may use a tent, a primitive structure, or no shelter at all.
Camping is often restricted by law to designated sites in order to prevent
campers from damaging the environment.

Camping as a recreational activity became popular in the early 20th century.
Campers frequent national parks and other publicly owned natural areas.

Definition

Camping describes a wide range of activities. Survivalist campers set off with
little more than their boots, whereas recreational vehicle travelers arrive
equipped with their own electricity, heat, and patio furniture. Camping may be
an end unto itself, but often it is done in conjunction with other activities,
such as hiking, swimming or fishing. It may be combined with hiking either as
backpacking or as a series of day hikes from a central location.  For
information about residential youth camping, try  Summer Camp.  

Some people vacation in permanent camps with cabins and other facilities  such
as hunting camps or children s summer camps , but a stay at such a camp is
usually not considered  camping . The term camping  or the slightly sarcastic
camping out  may also be applied to those who live outdoors out of necessity  as
in the case of the homeless  or for people waiting overnight in very long lines
 queues . It does not, however, apply to cultures whose technology does not
include sophisticated dwellings. Camping may be referred to colloquially as
roughing it.

Levels of comfort

 of the Boy Scouts of America shown here tent camping.]]

Campers span a broad range of ability and ruggedness, and campsites are designed
accordingly. Many campgrounds have sites with special facilities such as fire
rings, barbecue grills, bathrooms and utilities, but not all campsites have
similar levels of development. Campsites can range from a patch of dirt with a
sign marking it to a level, paved pad with sewer and electricity. These latter
are often designated for the use of handicapped campers. For more on facilities,
see the campsite article. Rugged campers believe that provisions for comfort
detract from the experience of being out of doors, but comfortable camping
avoids some hazards of outdoor activities.

The most comfortable form of camping uses recreational vehicles  RVs ,
essentially wheeled houses. Some call this style of camping  tinboxing . Many
RVs are quite luxurious, featuring air conditioning, bathrooms, kitchens,
showers, satellite TV and even Internet connections. RV campers often choose
these devices because they consider tent camping uncomfortable and inconvenient.
In the United States, some campgrounds offer  full hookups  where motorhomes are
supplied with electricity, water and sewer services. Some retirees and self 
employed people sell their homes and live nomadically in their RVs, often moving
with the seasons.

Those who seek a rugged experience in the outdoors prefer to camp with only
tents, or no shelter at all   under the stars  . Tent camping commonly employs
an automobile to transport equipment to an established campground  this practice
is called  car camping  . Other vehicles used for camping include touring
bicycles, boats, and even bush planes, although backpacking and using pack
animals are popular alternatives. Tent camping attracts young families because
the children tend to enjoy it, and because gear is inexpensive and rugged. Tent
camping sites often cost less than campsites with full amenities, and most allow
direct access by car. Some  walk in  sites lie a short walk away from the
nearest road but do not require full backpacking equipment.

Mobile camping , New York, USA.]] Backpacking is a mobile variety of tent
camping. Backpackers use lightweight equipment that can be carried long
distances on foot. They hike across the land, camping at remote spots, often
selecting campsites at will if resource protection rules allow. Backpacking
equipment typically costs more than that for car camping, but still far less
than a trailer or motorhome, and backpacking campsites are generally free.

Canoe camping is similar to backpacking, but uses canoes for transportation 
much more weight and bulk can be carried in a canoe or kayak than in a backpack.
Canoe camping is common in eastern North America.

One form of bicycle touring combines camping with cycling. The bicycle is used
to carry the gear and as the primary means of transportation, allowing greater
distances to be covered than backpacking although less capacity for storage

Specialized camping Survivalist campers learn the skills needed to survive out of 
doors in any situation. This activity may require skills in obtaining food from
the wild, emergency medical treatments, orienteering, and pioneering.

 Winter Camping  refers to the experience of camping outside when there is
sufficient snow on the ground. Some campers enjoy the challenge this form of
recreation brings. Campers and outdoorspeople have adapted their forms of
camping and survival to suit extremely cold nights and limited mobility or
evacuation. Methods of survival when winter camping include building snow
shelters  quinzhees , dressing in  layers,  staying dry, using low temperature
sleeping bags, and fueling the body with appropriate food.

Workamping allows campers to trade their labor for a free campsite, and
sometimes for utilities and </STYLE>

The /Western Tanager/, Piranga ludoviciana, is 

a medium/sized songbird of the
Tanager family, /Thraupidae/.

Adults have pale stout point

ed bills, yellow underparts and light wing bars.
Adult males have a bright red face and a 

yellow nape, shoulder, and rump, with
black upper back, wings, and tail/ in non/breeding p

lumage the head has no more
than a reddish cast and the body has an olive tinge. Females h

ave a yellow head
and are olive on the back, with dark wings and tail.

The song of discon

nected short phrases suggests an American Robin/s but is
hoarser and rather monotonous. Th

e call is described as /pit/er/ick/.

Their breeding habitat is coniferous or mixed woods 

across western North America
from the U.S./Mexican border as far north as southern Alaska/

 thus they are the
northernmost/breeding tanager. They build a flimsy cup nest on a horizo

ntal tree
branch, usually in a conifer. They lay four bluish/green eggs with brown spots.



These birds migrate, wintering from central Mexico to Costa Rica. Some also
winter in sou

thern California.

These birds are often out of sight, foraging high in trees, sometimes f

lying out
to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat insects, fruits and berries. At
time

s they offer spectacular views, and in much of their range, when a non/
birder tells a bir

der, /I saw the most amazing bird// the birder can guess it
was a male of this species.

 C/>Camping  is an outdoor recrea<ional activity, in which the camp/>pers get away
from civilization an< enjoy nature while spending one />or more nights at a
campsite. They may u<se a tent, a prim/>mitive structure, or no s<elter/> at all.
Camping is <often restricted by law to designated/> sites in order to prevent
cam<ers fro/>om damaging the environmen<.

Camping as a recreational ac/>ctivity became popular in <he early 20th century.
Campers freque/>nt national parks and other publicly ow<ed natural a/>areas.

Definition

Camping <describes a />wide range of activities. Survivalist c<ampers set off with
little more than t/>their boots, whereas recreation<l vehicle t/>travelers arrive
equipped <with their own elec/>ctricity, heat, and patio furniture.<Camping may be
an end unto it/>self, but often it is done in conjunctio<n with other activities,
such as h/>hiking, swimming or fishing. It may be <ombined with hiking either as
backpack/>ing or as a series of day hi<kes from a central location.  />For
information about res<dential youth camping, try  Summer Camp/>p.  

Some people<vacation in permanent camps wit/>th cabins and <ot/>her facilities  such
as hunting camps o<r child/>ren s summer ca<mps , but a stay at such a c/>camp is
usually n<t consider/>red  camping . The term campin<g  or the slig/>ghtly sarcastic
camping out  may<also be applied to those who live outdo/>ors out of neces<sity  as
in the case of/> the homeless  or for people< waiting overnigh/>ht in very long line<
 queues . It does not, howe/>ver, apply to cultures whose technolo<gy does not
incl/>lude sophisticated d<ellings. Camping m/>may be referred to collo<quially as
roughing it.

/>Levels of comfort

 of the< Boy Scouts of America sho/>wn here tent<camping.]]

Campers span a broad/> range of <bility a/>and ru<ggedn/>ess,< and camps/>sites are designed
accordingl<. Man/>ny campg<ounds have sites w/>with special facilities such<as fire
rings,/> barbecue gril<l/>s, bathrooms and utilities,< but not all c/>campsites h<ave/>
sim<lar levels of development. Campsites ca/>an range from <a patch of dirt with a
sign marki/>ng it to a leve<l, paved pa/>d wit<h sewer and e/>lectricity<. These />latter
are often designated for the use <of handicapped campers/>s. For more on facil<it/>ies,
see the campsite article. R<gged/>d campers b<lieve that provisions for comfort
detr/>ract from the experience of <bein/>ng <ut of doors, but comfortable campi/>ing
avoids some hazards of outdoor act<ivities.

The /> most comfort<ble form of camping uses recreatio/>nal vehicles  RVs< ,/>,
essentially wheele< houses. Some call this s/>tyle of camping  tinboxing . Many
RVs <are qui/>te luxurious, featuring<air conditioning, b/>bathrooms, <kitchens,
showers, satellite TV a/>and even<Internet connections. RV campers o/>ften ch<oose
these devices because they con/>sider tent camping uncomfortable a<nd inconv/>enient.
In th<e Un/>nited States, some campgrounds off<r  full hookups  whe/>ere motorhomes are
supplied with electri<city, water and sewer se/>rvices. Some retirees and self <
employed people sell t/>their homes and liv< nomadically in their /> RVs,<often moving
w/>ith the seasons.

Those who seek a rugge<d experience in the outdoors prefer to/>o camp with only
tents, or no <shelter at all   under the stars  . Tent/> camping commonly e<ploys
an automobi/>ile to tr<ansport equipment /> to an <stablishe/>ed campground  this practice
is calle<d  car camping  . O/>ther vehicles used for campin< include touring
bicycles, boats, and ev/>ven bush p<lanes, although backpacking an/>nd us<ng pack
animals are popular alternati/>ves. Tent camping attracts young famil<es because
the c/>children tend to enj<oy it, and because g/>ear is inexpen<sive and rugged. Tent
campin/>ng sites often< cost/> less than campsites with full ameniti<es, /> and mo<t allow
direct access by/> car. <Some  wa/>l< /> in  sites lie a short walk<away from the
nearest road but do no/>t require full backpacking equipment<.

Mobile camping , New York, />USA.]] Backpacking is a mobile< variety of tent
camping./> <B/>Backpackers use lightwe<ight eq/>qui<ment that can be c/>carried long
distances on foot.<They h/>hike across the lan<d/>, camping at<remote spots, ofte/>n
selecting<campsites at will if resource pr/>rotection rules allow. Backpacking
equi<pment typically costs m/>ore than that for<car camping, but/>t still far less
t<an a trailer or motorhome, an/>nd backpacking campsites are generally< f/>ree.

Canoe camping is similar to backp<cking, but uses canoes for transport/>tation 
much more weight <and bulk can be c/>carried <n a canoe/>e or kaya< than in a backpack.
C/>anoe camping is c<ommon in eastern North America.

One fo<rm of bicycle to/>ouring combines ca<p/>ing w<ith cycling. The/> bicycle is used
to carry th< gear and as the primary means o/>of tr<anspo/>rtation, allowing greater
dist<nces />to be covered than backpacking althou<gh les/>ss capacity for storage

Specia<ized camping/>g Survivalist campers l<e/>earn <he skills needed to s/>survive out of 
doors in any si<uation. This activity may requir/>e skills in obtaining food from
the wil<d, emergency medical treatments, orien/>teering, and pioneering<.

 Wint/>ter Camping  refers to the experienc< of camping outside when th/>ere is
sufficient s<no/>ow on the ground. Some ca<mper/>s enj<y the challenge this form /> of
recreation brings. Campers and outdo<rspe/>ople have adapted their forms o<f
camping and su/>rvival to s<uit extremely cold nights an/>d limited mobility or
evacuatio<n. M/>ethods of survival when winte<r camping include building snow
/>shelters  quinzhees , dressing in  la<ers,  staying dry, using low/>w temperature
sleeping< bags, and fuelin/>ng the body with ap<ropriate food.
