 /div   Alabama , also known as the  Heart of Dixie,  is a state located in the
Southern United States. Alabama is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia
to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the
west. The twenty second state admitted to the Union, Alabama seceded from the
union in 1861 to become part of the Confederate States of America. Following the
Civil War Alabama was readmitted to the union in 1868.

Until World War II, Alabama, like many Southern states, remained mired in
poverty. In the years following the war, Alabama emerged as a growing economic
power as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified
interests in heavy manufacturing, mineral extraction, education, and high
technology. Today, the state is heavily invested in the aerospace, education,
health care, banking, and various heavy industries including automobile
manufacturing and mineral extraction and steel production and fabrication.

Alabama is officially nicknamed the [[Northern Flicker Alabama Yellowhammer]]
state. The capital is Montgomery and the largest city is Birmingham.

Geography


Alabama is the 30 sup th /sup  largest state in the United States with 52,423
square miles  135,775 nbsp km    of total area. 3.19  of that is water, making
Alabama 23 sup rd /sup  in the amount of surface water, also giving it the
second largest inland waterway system in the United States. ref  /ref  Baldwin
County, along the gulf coast, is the largest county in the state in both land
area and water area.  ref  /ref  About three fifths of the land area is a gentle
plain with a general decline towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of
Mexico. The North Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the Tennessee River
cutting a large valley creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and
lakes. ref name  NetState   /ref  Another natural wonder is  Natural Bridge ,
the longest land bridge span east of the Mississippi River. Alabama generally
ranges in elevation from sea level ref name usgs/  at Mobile Bay, to a little
more than 1,800 feet  550 nbsp m  in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast.
The highest point is Mount Cheaha. ref name  NetState / 

States bordering Alabama include Tennessee to the north  Georgia to the east 
Florida to the south  and Mississippi to the west. Alabama has coastline at the
Gulf of Mexico in the extreme southern edge of the state. ref name  NetState /

/Watermelon/ /Citrullus lanatus, Family Cucurbitaceae/ is both a fruit and 

a
vegetable/ref/National Watermelon Promotional Board, /Watermelon Facts/, pg.
1//ref/ and

 plant of a vine/like /climber and trailer/ herb originally from
southern Africa and one o

f the most common type of melon. This flowering plant
produces a special type of fruit kno

wn by botanists as a pepo, which has a thick
rind /exocarp/ and fleshy center /mesocarp an

d endocarp// pepos are derived from
an inferior ovary and are characteristic of the Cucurb

itaceae. The watermelon
fruit, loosely considered a type of melon /although not in the gen

us
[[Cucumis]]/, has a smooth exterior rind /green and yellow/ and a juicy, sweet,
usually

 red or yellow, but sometimes orange, interior flesh. The flesh consists
of highly develop

ed placental tissue within the fruit. The former name Citrullus
vulgaris /vulgaris meaning

 /common/ /mdash/ Shosteck, 1974/, is now a synonym of
the accepted scientific name for wa

termelon, Citrullus lanatus. History

David Livingstone, an explorer of Africa, described 

watermelon as abundant in
the Kalahari Desert, where it is believed to have originated. Th

ere, the
ancestral melon grows wild and is known as the /Tsamma/ melon /Citrullus lanatus


var citroides/. It is recognizable by its pinnatifid leaves and prolific fruit,
up to 100 

melons on a single vine. For this reason it is a popular source of
water in the diet of th

e indigenous people. The flesh is similar to the rind of
a watermelon and is often known a

s citron melon /distinct from the actual
citron, of the citrus family// it is used for mak

ing pickles, and because of its
high content of pectin is popular as a constituent of jams

, jellies, and other
gelled preserves. It has established itself in the wild in Baja Calif

ornia.



It is not known when the plant was first cultivated, but Zohary and Hopf note
ev

idence of its cultivation in the Nile Valley from at least as early as the
second millenni

um BC. Finds of the characteristically large seed are reported in
Twelfth dynasty sites/ n

umerous watermelon seeds were recovered from the tomb of
Pharaoh Tutankhamun./ref/Daniel Z

ohary and Maria Hopf, Domestication of Plants
in the Old World, third edition /Oxford/ Uni

versity Press, 2000/, p. 193.//ref/

By the 10th century AD, watermelons were being cultiv

ated in China, which is
today the world/s single largest watermelon producer. By the 13th 

century,
Moorish invaders had introduced the fruit to Europe/ and, according to John
Maria

ni/s The Dictionary of American Food and Drink, /watermelon/ made its first
appearance in 

an English dictionary in 1615.

Museums Online South Africa list watermelons as having bee

n introduced to North
American Indians in the 1500s. Early French explorers found Native A

mericans
cultivating the fruit in the Mississippi Valley. Many sources list the
watermelon

 as being introduced in Massachusetts as early as 1629. Southern food
historian John Egert

on has said he believes African slaves helped introduce the
watermelon to the United State

s. Texas Agricultural Extension horticulturalist
Jerry Parsons, Ph.D., lists African slave

s and European colonists as having
distributed watermelons to many areas of the world. Par

sons also mentions the
crop being farmed by Native Americans in Florida /by 1664/ and the 

Colorado
River area /by 1799/. Other early watermelon sightings include the Midwestern
sta

tes /1673/, Connecticut /1747/, and the Illiana region /1822/.


Until the 1940s, however,

 it was hard to find watermelons in good condition at
grocery stores. Melon lovers had to 

grow their own, which tended not to keep for
long, purchase them from local grocers suppli

ed by truck farmers, or purchase
them from roadside produce stands. Now they can be found 

in most any local
grocery store, and if preferred in slices or whole, with seeds or withou

t.

Then Charles Fredric Andrus, a horticulturist at the USDA Vegetable Breeding
Laborator

y in Charleston, South Carolina, set out to produce a disease/resistant
and wilt/resistant

 watermelon. The result was /that gray melon from Charleston./
Its oblong shape and hard r

ind made it easy to stack and ship. Its adaptability
meant it could be grown over a wide g

eographical area. It produced high yields
and was resistant to the most serious watermelon

 diseases/ anthracnose and
fusarium wilt. Today, farmers in approximately 44 states in the

 U.S. grow
watermelon commercially, and almost all these varieties have some Charleston
Gr

ay in their lineage. Georgia, Florida, Texas, California and Arizona are the
USA/s largest

 watermelon producers.

This now/common watermelon is large enough that groceries often se

ll half or
quarter melons. There are also some smaller, spherical varieties of watermelon,


both red/ and yellow/fleshed, sometimes called /icebox melons./

Souther/>n U<nited States. Alabama is bor/>dered by Te<nessee to the north, Georgia/>a
<o the east, Florida and the G/>ulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississi<pp/>i to the

power />as the ec<onomy of the stat/>e transitioned from agri<ulture to diversified
interes/>sts in heavy manufac<uring, mineral extraction, educat/>tion, and high
technology. Today,<the state is heavily invested in the/>e aerospace, education,
health care, ba<king, and various heavy industries inc/>luding automobile
manu<actur/>ring and mineral ext<action and /> s<eel production a/>nd f<brication.
