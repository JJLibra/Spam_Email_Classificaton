Dear Friend,

My name is Attah Seidu Bukari, I am 30 years old and I am from brong ahafo,
Ghana, Western Africa. I would be very glad if you can be my foreign guarantor
to help me claim and invest us$10m that I inherited from my late father's on
any profitable business ventures over there in your country. I will offer you
20% for your assistance render while you will assist me invest part of my own
80% on any profitable business venture there in your country.

The fund is sealed airtight in a two aluminiun boxes. The two boxes is presently
deposited in a security company. My father's didn't registered the contents of
the boxes as funds, he registered it as his family treasury bill for many
security reasons. I am the next of  kin to my late father vault account.

 Now, I have contacted the security company for the claim of my late father's
deposited boxes but due to my underage {30 years old}, the security company are
demanding for a guarantor that will claim the boxes for me to avoid a future
controversy.  My father registered me to be 35 years old above before having
access or right to withdraw the boxes.
What I need from you is to send me your full name, personal contact address,
personal telephone number with attach copy of your international passport or
drivers license so that I can put in an application letter with this your
information and foraward to the security company as my foreign guarantor.  I
will change the new ownership certificate to your name so we can have a power
of attorney to athourize the security company to let me withdraw the two boxes
on your behalf.

Immediately I withdraw the boxes and access the fund,  I will then  open a local
bank account in your name here in africa and deposit the whole amount into this
local bank account. We don't need your personal banking information,
immediatley, I lay my hands on the fund, I will even send you us$25,000 to use
in opening of a virgin foreign account in your name over there in your country.
I will submit the banking information to the local bank to onward transfer the
fund from your local bank account into your opened virgin foreign account in
your country.

While transfering the fund to your opened foreign account,  We will obtain all
the necessary documents that will proof the source of this fund to your bank or
country that the source of this fund is not money laundering, anti-terrorist
money, drug traficking money or an embezzled money from government account.

I will be waiting to hear from you soon so I can tell you what next to do. I
will also send you a deposit certificate for your verification.

Please, if interested, kindly reply me through my confidential email address :
attamehab17@walla.com for more details.



Best Regards,

Attah Seidu Bukari.
