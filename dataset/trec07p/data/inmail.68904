Imagine  being  part    of     a      stable   organization    with      a     sterling     reputation -      a  place     where    the     Sydney  Car  Centre     is    an      integral      part   of      all      that   we     do.

Today    the Sydney     Car       Centre      is     looking for       an       industrious  regional  assistant      to       fasten     the     process  of   the delivery of   customer   payments     to   the    suppliers. The   position      offered    is       a     part-time    job,   and    will       only      require    from  you   to  be       available      for  1-2 hours       a       day.<br><br>

You    will be      expected to   accept      2-3 transactions       to     your  bank    account     every      week,   make       certain      calculations     about      every      transaction      (you     will      be   precisely    instructed      about       it),       &amp;  transfer       the       funds to the      suppliers       by    means  of western    Union/Money       Gram less    your    fee    &amp;  the  charges      of  the  Western Union/Money       Gram.      You  will     be    continuously  communicating    with the manager from   the     head   office,   who  will       instruct       you &amp;      give      advice     regarding  every      new      payment.<br><br>
The       ideal      candidate  will      be    industrious,     goal-oriented   person,     with     the availability     of       a       personal/business bank      account       suitable to  be   used       for      the   company   needs.

All       the    related       expenses   you      might  have  (like the       Western     Union/Money       Gram    chargers,     related      expenses   on   traveling)       are     covered       by  the     company.<br><br>
