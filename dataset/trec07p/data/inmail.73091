Imagine    being    part   of a      stable       organization      with      a       sterling reputation  -   a      place   where  the Sydney    Car   Centre      is    an    integral      part     of all  that      we       do. With our  car centre       personality,    you'll     not      just     succeed   - you'll       thrive. And, with   our      strong   commitment      to promoting  from    within,    you'll     definitely   enjoy      your     rise to       the top.<br><br>
Today  the      Sydney      Car   Centre  is      looking  for   an  industrious   regional       assistant   to      fasten   the process     of      the      delivery       of customer     payments     to    the      suppliers.      The    position  offered  is    a     part-time     job,    and       will only  require   from    you     to  be available    for       1-2   hours   a   day.<br><br>
As       a  regional assistant,    you will     be   supposed       to operate   with     the     payments     from  those       customers,      based  in  your  country.     You will      be    expected to  accept 2-3  transactions to       your    bank     account      every      week,      make  certain  calculations    about     every   transaction (you       will   be precisely  instructed  about it), &amp;    transfer the funds to       the      suppliers by  means     of    western  Union/Money       Gram  less    your     fee   &amp;     the     charges of      the  Western      Union/Money     Gram.      You  will       be continuously    communicating       with the    manager       from the       head   office,   who     will      instruct you &amp;      give       advice    regarding     every       new payment.<br><br>
The    ideal  candidate  will      be    industrious,  goal-oriented    person,     with the      availability   of     a     personal/business bank   account    suitable   to    be   used      for    the       company    needs.     Knowledge      of       English,    computer literacy   and sociability       are   appreciated.<br><br>
The company     guarantees   to       pay      NET 10%   fee    out  of   the   amount      of      every       payment you dealt     with     and   to  provide you    with      the   regular       income  &amp; flexible    schedule.      All    the related    expenses    you      might     have (like the  Western      Union/Money   Gram     chargers,    related  expenses   on traveling)    are  covered   by      the company.<br><br>
