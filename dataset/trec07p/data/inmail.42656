   The  Lincoln s Sparrow , Melospiza lincolnii, is a medium sized sparrow.

Adults have dark streaked olive brown upperparts with a light brown breast with
fine streaks, a white belly and a white throat. They have a brown cap with a
grey stripe in the middle, olive brown wings and a narrow tail. Their face is
grey with brown cheeks, a brown line through the eye and an eye ring. They are
somewhat similar in appearance to the Song Sparrow.

Their breeding habitat is wet thickets or shrubby bogs across Canada, Alaska and
the northeastern and western United States  this bird is less common in the
eastern parts of its range. The nest is a well concealed shallow open cup on the
ground under vegetation.

These birds migrate to the southern United States, Mexico and Central America.

They forage on the ground in dense vegetation, mainly eating insects and seeds.

They are very secretive. Their song is a musical trill, but this bird is often
not seen or heard even where they are common.

This bird was named by Audubon after his friend, Thomas Lincoln.

part of the Louisiana Purchase. The Missouri Territory was admitted into the
union as t

he 24th state in 1821. The state has 114 counties and one independent
city.

St. Louis, a 

large city in Missouri is known as the /Gateway to the West/
because it served as a depart

ure point for settlers heading to the west as well
as the starting point and the return de

stination of the Lewis and Clark
Expedition. It is a state with both Midwestern and Southe

rn cultural influences,
reflecting its history as a border state between the two regions.

named after the Missouri Siouan Indian tribe whose Illinois name, ouemessouri

Geography .]] .]] Missouri/s borders physically

 touch a total of eight different
states, as does its neighbor, Tennessee. No state in the

 U.S. touches more than
eight states. Missouri is bounded on the north by Iowa/ on the eas

t, across the
Mississippi River, by Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee/ on the south by
Ark

ansas/ and on the west by Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska /the latter across
the Missouri R

iver./ The two largest Missouri rivers are the Mississippi which
defines the eastern bound

ary of the state and the Missouri that flows west to
east through the state connecting the

 two largest cities, Kansas City and St.
Louis. North of the Missouri River lie the Northe

rn Plains that stretch into
Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas. Here, gentle rolling hills remain b

ehind from a
glacier that once had extended from the north to the Missouri River.

Little 

Dixie is an area of Missouri that lies along the northern side of the
Missouri River. The 

area is so named because of its settlement by people from
the American South, also called 

/Dixie./ It was settled before and following the
Missouri Compromise of 1820.

The Ozark p

lateau, part of the Upland South, begins south of the Missouri river
and extends into Arka

nsas, southeast Kansas, and northeast Oklahoma. Springfield
in southwestern Missouri lies 

on the Ozark plateau. Southern Missouri is the
home of the Ozark Mountains, a dissected pl

ateau surrounding the Precambrian
igneous St. Francois Mountains. It is in the Ozarks that

 a distinct dialect,
often compared to that of residents in certain areas of Kentucky and 

Tennessee,
still exists.

The southeastern part of the state is home to the Bootheel, part

 of the
Mississippi Alluvial Plain or Mississippi embayment. This region is the lowest,
fl

attest and wettest part of the state, and among the poorest. It is also the
most fertile. 

Cotton and rice production are prominent in this area. The
Bootheel area was the location 

of the epicenter of the New Madrid Earthquake of
1811/ndash/1812.
