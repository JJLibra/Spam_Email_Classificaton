I am 52 years old. I take Atenolol for mild high blood pressure. After taking the blood pressure medicine for about a year, I noticed that my erections were not as firm or lasting as before. So, I consulted with a doctor and got a prescription for Cialis. The first experience after taking 50 mg was unbelievable. Within 15 minutes I was rock hard with much more girth. I couldn't wait to get my wife into bed. She loves getting on top and couldn't believe how hard and larger I was. We had fabulous sex and I came like a fire hose. I have experimented with dosage and now find that 25 mg about one half hour before sex is perfect for me. I'm rock hard and can go forever. I can achieve another hard-on within a half hour after and can keep going for as long as she wants. Some nasal congestion right after taking, but it is worth it. Works good for masturbation too.

I take meds for high blood pressure and diabetes. I started having problems with losing my erection after a few minutes. When I told my doctor, he asked if I wanted to try Cialis. I said sure. He wrote the script for 50mg and advised trying splitting them in half. I took a 25mg dose and was amazed. I got very hard and lasted a good half hour before my orgasm. We rested 10 minutes or so and then was erect again. Works the same every time now. Even 6 to 8 hrs later I find myself getting a hard erection.<br>
