 George Canning   11 April 1770   8 August 1827  was a British statesman and
politician who served as Foreign Secretary and, briefly, Prime Minister.

Early life Canning was born between 8 and 9 in the morning at his parents  home
in Queen Anne Street, Marylebone, London. His father, George Canning Sr. of
Garvagh, County Londonderry was a gentleman of limited means, a failed wine
merchant and lawyer, who renounced his right to inherit the family estate in
exchange for payment of his substantial debts. George Sr. eventually abandoned
the family and died in poverty on 11 April 1771, his son s first birthday, in
London. Canning s mother, Mary Ann Costello, took work as a stage actress, a
profession not considered respectable at the time.

Because Canning showed unusual intelligence and promise at an early age, family
friends persuaded his uncle, London merchant Stratford Canning  father to the
diplomat Stratford Canning , to become his nephew s guardian. George Canning
grew up with his cousins at the home of his uncle, who provided him with an
income and an education. Stratford Canning s financial support allowed the young
Canning to study at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford.

While at school, Canning gained renown for his skill in writing and debate. He
struck up friendships with Lord Liverpool, Granville Leveson Gower, and John
Hookham Frere. Canning began practising Law after receiving his BA from Oxford
in the summer of 1791. Yet he wished to enter politics.

Entry into politics , London]]

Stratford Canning was a Whig and would introduce his nephew in the 1780s to
prominent Whigs such as Charles James Fox, Edmund Burke, and Richard Brinsley
Sheridan. George Canning s friendship with Sheridan would last for the remainder
of Sheridan s life.

George Canning s impoverished background and limited financial resources,
however, made unlikely a bright political future in a Whig party whose political
ranks were led mostly by members of the wealthy landed aristocracy in league
with the newly rich industrialist classes. Regardless, along with Whigs such as
Burke, Canning himself would become considerably more conservative in the early
1790s after witnessing the excessive radicalism of the French Revolution.

So when Canning decided to enter politics he sought and received the patronage
of the leader of the  To</STYLE>

In the broadest possible sense, /fencing/ is the art of armed combat involving
cutting,

 stabbing, or bludgeoning weapons directly manipulated by hand, rather
than shot or thrown

. Example weapons include swords, knives, pikes, bayonets,
batons, clubs, and similar. In 

contemporary common usage, /fencing/ tends to
refer specifically to European schools of sw

ordsmanship and to the modern
Olympic sport that has evolved out of them.

Fencing is one 

of the four sports which has been featured at every modern
Olympic Games. Currently, three

 types of weapon are used in Olympic fencing/
/ Foil /mdash/ a light thrusting weapon/ the

 valid target is restricted to the
  torso/ double hits are not allowed, /see priority rul

es below/.
/ //p//e /mdash/ a heavier thrusting weapon/ the valid target area covers the
 

 entire body/ double hits are allowed.
/ Sabre /mdash/ a light cutting and thrusting weapo

n/ the valid target area
  includes almost everything above the waist /excluding the back 

of the head and
  the palms of the hands// double hits are not allowed, /see priority rule

s
  below/.

Etymology/ The word /fence/ was originally a shortening of the Middle English


/defens/. The first known use in reference to swordsmanship is in William
Shakespeare/s M

erry Wives of Windsor/ /Alas sir, I cannot fence./ /ref/Harper,
