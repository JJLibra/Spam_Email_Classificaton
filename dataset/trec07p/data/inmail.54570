Imagine being      part of   a    stable  organization  with    a   sterling      reputation     -     a   place   where  the     Sydney Car Centre is    an    integral     part    of   all  that      we do.  With     our  car   centre       personality, you'll     not    just       succeed      -     you'll   thrive.

As      a    regional  assistant,   you will be      supposed      to  operate with      the       payments    from those       customers,    based  in       your   country.  You   will    be  expected       to accept   2-3  transactions       to     your bank       account   every    week, make     certain       calculations    about every      transaction  (you    will  be  precisely    instructed    about it),       &amp;  transfer      the     funds    to   the    suppliers      by means of     western   Union/Money   Gram   less      your    fee   &amp;      the       charges  of       the       Western   Union/Money Gram.      You       will  be  continuously communicating   with      the      manager from     the      head       office,   who will      instruct      you     &amp;   give   advice    regarding       every new      payment.<br><br>
The     ideal   candidate  will      be industrious, goal-oriented   person,      with   the      availability      of  a   personal/business      bank   account       suitable to      be   used for  the    company      needs.

All   the       related expenses you  might       have     (like    the       Western     Union/Money Gram   chargers,   related       expenses       on  traveling)       are       covered     by   the     company.<br><br>
