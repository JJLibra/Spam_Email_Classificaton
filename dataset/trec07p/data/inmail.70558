<=21--MEYERS, Calif. - A raging wildfire near Lake Tahoe on Monday forced hundreds of resi=
dents to flee towering flames that destroyed more than 200 buildings, turned the sky orang=
e and fouled the lake's famously clear waters with falling ash.=20

=20
Many hotels offered free rooms as families clung to one bit of good news: Despite the destru=
ction, there were no reports of injuries.

=22All the memories are gone,=22 said Matt Laster, a legal assistant forced to flee his ren=
ted home of five years with his wife, two young children and cat. He showed up at a recreation=
 center looking for clothes and a sleeping bag.

The blaze had scorched almost 2,500 acres =E2=80=94 nearly 4 square miles =E2=80=94 but by=
 early Monday evening fire officials said the blaze was about 40 percent contained. Full co=
ntainment was expected by Sunday, the U.S. Forest Service said.

About 1,000 people had evacuated from the path of the flames, and authorities feared up to 5=
00 other houses could be threatened in this resort area along the California-Nevada state=
 line.

More than 700 firefighters were on hand, but plans to send up airborne tankers and helicopt=
ers to drop water and retardant over the heavily wooded, parched terrain were scrapped bec=
ause of low visibility from the thick smoke.

Firefighters hoped to bring the blaze under control ahead of high winds and low humidity fo=
recast for the middle of the week. Dozens took up defensive positions around South Lake Tah=
oe High School as flames came within a quarter mile of the 1,500-student school.

=22We have a window right now where we're really trying to aggressively attack this fire,=
=22 said Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Pr=
otection in Sacramento.

El Dorado County Sheriff's Lt. Kevin House said there were no reports of missing persons, b=
ut =22the truth is we haven't really been able to get in there and see.=22

Along the lake's southern shore, a layer of black, mushy ash lapped along boat docks, raisi=
ng fears the fire also could have disastrous long-term economic consequences for a commun=
ity heavily dependent on the lake's recreational tourism.

California officials declared a state of emergency, meaning the state would cover all fir=
efighting costs. The National Weather Service issued a dense smoke advisory warning peop=
le from South Lake Tahoe to Carson City, Nev., that heavy ash was making it difficult to see a=
nd breathe.

The fire began Sunday afternoon on a ridge separating the resort community of South Lake Ta=
hoe from Fallen Leaf Lake, a recreation area where a U.S. Forest Service campground was eva=
cuated.

Firefighters were aided Monday by winds that had slowed to 12 mph after gusting to about 35 m=
ph the day before. Forecasters warned that if high winds and low humidity returned, the fir=
e could threaten more than 500 homes bordering the lake.

By early afternoon Monday, 173 homes had been lost to flames and many others were damaged, a=
long with dozens of outbuildings, authorities said. All that remained of entire neighbor=
hoods in Meyers were the smoldering silhouettes of stone and concrete chimneys.

In other areas, the fire seemed to randomly skip some homes, but downed power lines, trees a=
nd debris made clear that life would not return to normal anytime soon, even for those whose=
 homes were spared.

The burned neighborhoods were a hodgepodge of million-dollar vacation homes, cabins and=
 modest houses strung along the east side of the ridge. At least three members of the local fi=
re department were believed to have lost their homes.

Steve Yingling, sports editor for the Tahoe Tribune newspaper, had little hope that his ho=
use survived. He was leaving for work Sunday afternoon when he heard the sirens.

=22I looked back and saw the huge plume of smoke,=22 he said Monday. =22That's when I really=
 started to get scared because I know the danger alert that we've had in this area. Especiall=
y this year with the mild winter that we had.=22=20

State and federal fire officials had warned of a potentially active wildfire season in the=
 Sierra Nevada following an unusually dry winter. The annual May 1 snow survey found the Tah=
oe-area snowpack at just 29 percent of normal levels, the lowest since 1988.=20

Fire restrictions have been in effect in the Tahoe National Forest since June 11. The most c=
ommon cause of blazes in the area is abandoned campfires, according to the U.S. Forest Serv=
ice.=20

Anxious residents barred from returning to the fire-damaged area jammed the lobby of Lake=
 Tahoe Community College in South Lake Tahoe, hoping to get word from authorities on whethe=
r their homes were still standing. Some left in tears; others were thankful to have escaped=
 the worst.=20

Cathy Martin of South Lake Tahoe e-mailed her son, a Marine serving in Iraq, to tell him abou=
t the fire.=20

=22We're very lucky that we are safe,=22 said Martin, whose home was not damaged. =22But I'=

In Alaska, damp, cooler weather helped slow a wildfire in a popular recreation area on the K=
