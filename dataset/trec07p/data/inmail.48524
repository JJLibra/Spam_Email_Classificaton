Subject: Fake Products


We are bringing this to everyone's attention:

Currently there are several sites offering the W-e-i-g-h-t Loss m-i-r-a-c-l-e H00DIA.
99% of the H00DIA sold Online is fake, and results will be minimum.

All the H00DIA that's sold in the USA isn't the real stuff. 
The real stuff was bought by the FDA and will be a drug. 
Not sold over the counter at all. 

Solution:
You can try and convince your D0CT0R that you really need it, or you can visit any offshore H00DIA Site.  
We have listed a site where we were able to successfully order several bottles from. Their packaging was 
discrete and only took 6-10 days to deliver.
