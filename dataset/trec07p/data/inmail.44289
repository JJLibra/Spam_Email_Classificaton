Always be ready! 

If you have a problem getting or keeping an erection, 
you are not alone. In fact, more than half of all men 
over forty have difficulties getting or maintaining an 
erection. This condition, called erectile dysfunction 
(ED), occurs with younger and older men as well, but 
there's a safe, effective and easy method of treatment: Viagra. 

When the time is right, you'll always be ready.
