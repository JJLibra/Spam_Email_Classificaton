The  Murray cod   Maccullochella peelii peelii  is a large and striking
predatory freshwater fish of the [[Maccullochella]] genus and the Percichthyidae
family. It is an important and charismatic part of Australia s vertebrate
wildlife and is found in the Murray Darling river system in Australia. The
 Murray cod  is the largest wholly freshwater fish in Australia, and one of the
largest wholly freshwater fish in the world. Other common names for Murray cod
include cod, greenfish and goodoo.

The scientific name of Murray cod derives from an early Australian fish
researcher with the surname McCulloch   Maccullochella  and the river from which
the explorer Major Mitchell first scientifically described the species, the Peel
River   peeli . This was later changed to M. peelii peelii to differentiate
Murray cod from Mary River cod  see Related Species  which are currently
designated as a sub species of Murray cod.

Description Murray cod are a large grouper like fish with a deep, elongated body
that is round in cross section. They have a broad, scooped head, and a large
mouth lined with pads of very small needle like teeth. In Murray cod the jaws
are equal or the lower jaw protrudes slightly.

In Murray cod the spiny dorsal fin is moderate to low in height and is partially
separated by a notch from the high, rounded soft dorsal fin. Soft dorsal, anal
and caudal  tail  fins are all large and rounded, and are dusky grey or black
with distinct white edges. The large, rounded pectoral fins are usually similar
in colour to flanks. The pelvic fins are large and angular and set forward of
the pectoral fins. The leading white coloured rays on the pelvic fins split into
two trailing white filaments, while the pelvic fins themsel</STYLE>

/The Ozarks/ /also referred to as /Ozarks Mou

ntain Country/, the /Ozark
Mountains/ or the /Ozark Plateau// is a physiographic, geologic

, and cultural
highland region of the central United States. It covers much of the souther

n
half of Missouri and an extensive portion of northwest and north central
Arkansas. The r

egion also extends westward into extreme southeast Kansas and
northeastern Oklahoma.

Alth

ough sometimes referred to as the Ozark Mountains, the region is a high and
deeply dissect

ed plateau. Geologically, the area is a broad dome around the
Saint Francois Mountains. Th

e Ozark Highlands area, the Ouachita Mountains of
Arkansas and Oklahoma, and the Black Hil

ls of South Dakota are the only major
highland regions in the U.S. between the Appalachian

s and the Rocky Mountains.
The Ozarks and Ouachitas are sometimes referred to collectively

. For example,
the ecoregion called Ozark Mountain Forests includes the Ouachita Mountains

,
although the Arkansas River valley and the Ouachitas, both south of the Boston
Mountains

, are not usually considered part of the Ozarks.

Origin of the name Etymology of the name

 is a subject of speculation.
