Quite soon we will open representative offices and authorized sales centers in North America and therefore we are currently looking for people who will assist us in establishing a new distribution network there. The fact that despite the Nothern America market 
is new for us we already have regular clients also speaks for itself. 
 
WHY YOU? 
The international money transfer tax for legal entities (companies) in Australia is 35%, whereas for the individual it is only 10%. Thats why we need you, We need agents to receive payment for our products in their locality and to resend the money back to us. This way we will save money because of tax decreasing. 

HOW MUCH WILL YOU EARN? 
8%-10% from each sale/resale operation! For instance: you receive 2000 USD to your bank account. You will withdraw the money and keep $160 (8% from $2000) for yourself! At the beginning your commission will equal 8%, though later it will increase up to 10%. 
 
ADVANTAGES 
You do not have to go out as you will work as an independent contractor right from your home office.Your job is absolutely legal. You can earn up to $4000-5000 depending on time you will spend in this business. You do not need any capital to start. The employees who make efforts and work hard have a strong possibility to become managers. Anyway our employees never leave us.
