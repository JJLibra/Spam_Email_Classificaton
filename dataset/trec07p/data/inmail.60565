          <p>Just because the Dow recovered 150 points on Friday, June 8th we&rsquo;re not out of the woods.  </p>
          <p>No way!  The three-day, 400-point Dow sell-off from the week before underscores some serious problems that could easily split Wall Street into two separate halves: those who lose a bundle and those who make out like bandits. </p>

Since 1984, his recommendations have not only handed his readers 900% profits but also won him six &quot;Financial Advisory&quot; awards from the Newsletter and Electronic Publishers Foundation. As of this writing, his current portfolio includes 38 low-risk high-income stocks &ndash; 36   have substantial gains; only two have losses. </span></p>
                    <p class="style4">His average gain per stock is a remarkable 40%. In addition, his Incredible Dividend Machine rising stocks are on track to hand investors 16% annual dividends.  As a result, Richard is a popular speaker at investment conferences. He is also the author of Contrary Investing, which was named &quot;Best Investment Book&quot; of 1985 and hailed by Barron's as one of the most moving and readable presentations on the subject.&quot;</p></td>

          <p>I&rsquo;m Richard Band, and in all my years, I&rsquo;ve never seen more conflicting signals of both boom and bust.  On one hand earnings reports continue to look strong as U.S. corporations continue to increase sales and grow profits. </p>
          <p>On the other hand, rising interest rates and gas prices could burst this bubble and send millions of unwitting investors directly to the poorhouse. </p>
          <p>What should you do? Buy? Sell? Play it safe on the sidelines? </p>
          <h3 align="center"><a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf2?CURBWBUFS2-3317975-8HN153-8HN153-IPLACEREPORTS@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA">Log In to Tomorrow's FREE Online Conference</a> and Avoid the Mistakes Others Will Make. HURRY&mdash;Time is Running Out.  </h3>
          <p>Make no mistake about it&mdash;this market is changing fast.  Unless you have a plan to react to it, you could easily find yourself owning the wrong stocks in the wrong sectors and missing out on this market&rsquo;s biggest profit opportunities. </p>
          <p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important that you attend my special Online Conference tomorrow, Wednesday, June 20th at 4:00 p.m. ET, and email me your questions.  That way I can give you both my economic overview of the critical factors that are affecting the markets now, along with the specific actions to take on your own account. <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf2?CURBWBUFS2-3317975-8HN153-8HN153-IPLACEREPORTS@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA">Click here to attend</a>. </p>
          <p>Those who listened in on my June 2006 Online Conference profited handsomely. Investors who followed my lead captured a 14% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in just eight months. Of course, you did even better if you bought the specific stocks I recommended in that call. </p>
          <p>Today&rsquo;s situation is eerily similar to last June&rsquo;s&mdash;the same forces are in play in the market, which means you could see the same profits (or more) in the next eight months if you know where to look. </p>
          <h3 align="center"> Here&rsquo;s What I&rsquo;ll Be Covering on Wednesday:</h3>
                      <li> The driving force behind June&rsquo;s big three-day sell-off and the surprising odds that you&rsquo;ll <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf2?CURBWBUFS2-3317975-8HN153-8HN153-IPLACEREPORTS@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA"></a>see other 400 point (or higher!) sell-offs later this year. <br><br></li>
            <li> How China&rsquo;s cooling stock market, rising labor rates and increased speculation will affect your portfolio&mdash;even if you don&rsquo;t own one China stock.<a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf2?CURBWBUFS2-3317975-8HN153-8HN153-IPLACEREPORTS@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA"><img src="http://images.investorplace.com/e_images/rbwb/boom/call_out_box.gif" alt="box" width="350" height="202" border="0" align="right"></a><br>
            <br> </li>
            <li> What&rsquo;s really driving the private equity boom.  How it&rsquo;s making shrewd investors rich.  <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf2?CURBWBUFS2-3317975-8HN153-8HN153-IPLACEREPORTS@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA"></a>How you can get into the game and bank big profits without sticking your neck out.<br><br> </li>
            <li> PLUS...What you&rsquo;re not being told about the subprime lending crisis...how to play $65 oil...top takeover targets now...and much more. <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf2?CURBWBUFS2-3317975-8HN153-8HN153-IPLACEREPORTS@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA"></a><br></li>
           <p><u>I can&rsquo;t stress this enough:</u>  The biggest mistake you can make now is not understanding the forces at work in the marketplace.<br>
          </p>
          <p>I don&rsquo;t want to see that happen to you. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s critical that you join me online on Wednesday at 4:00 p.m. ET so that you&rsquo;ll be in a better position to make the right decisions. <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf2?CURBWBUFS2-3317975-8HN153-8HN153-IPLACEREPORTS@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA">Don&rsquo;t miss out&mdash;click here now. </a></p>
