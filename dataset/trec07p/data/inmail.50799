Dear valued member.
This is a letter from United Medical Research Organization. We just wanted to ask you to be as attentive as possible when buying drugs on the Web.
The drugs you purchase on the Web are in many ways similar to a time bomb – malicious elements found in low-quality meds accumulate in human organism damaging the organs they should be curing. Our Association recommends you to buy your drugs from USDrugs pharmacy since it’s one of very few e-shops selling ONLY generic drugs.
Please, be more discerning when choosing your Web pharmacy.

If you have any more questions please contact to me.
Please include all previous messages in your email's.

Thank you and best regards
