The  Bobcat   Lynx rufus  is a North American mammal of the cat family, Felidae.
It ranges from southern Canada to northern Mexico, including much of the
continental United States. A mid sized wild cat, the Bobcat is an adaptable
predator that inhabits wooded areas as well as semi desert, urban, and swampland
environments. It utilizes several methods to mark its territorial boundaries
including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces.

In appearance, the Bobcat has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and tail.
It also has prominent, pointed ears with short tufts of black hair at the tip.
The name is derived from its stubby black tipped tail that, unlike those of
other species of the genus [[Lynx]], have a white underside. Its coat is most
often light gray or various shades of brown in color, with varying degrees of
black spots either dispersed along much of its body or relegated to the
otherwise white underparts. The Bobcat is twice as large as a house cat but
typically smaller than the related Canadian Lynx. The adult male, averaging
36 nbsp inches  90 nbsp cm  in length, and weighing from 16 to 30 nbsp pounds  7
to 14 nbsp kg , is generally 30 40  larger than the female.

The Bobcat is a carnivorous animal  it prefers rabbits and hares but will hunt
anything from insects and small rodents to deer. Prey selection will depend on
location and habitat, season, and abundance. The Bobcat breeds from winter into
the spring and has a gestation period of about two months. The kittens will stay
with the mother until about a year old.

Taxonomy

There has been some debate over whether to classify this species as Lynx rufus
or Felis rufus. Although the former is the preferred scientific name, the debate
is part of a wider issue as to whether the four species of Lynx should be given
their own genus, or simply placed as a subgenus in genus [[Felis]]. ref
name tx  /ref  Johnson et al. report that the Lynx genus shared a clade with the
[[Puma]], leopard cat  [[Prionailurus]] , and domestic cat  [[Felis]]  lineages,
dated to 7.15 nbsp Ma  Lynx diverged first, approximately 3.24 nbsp Ma.  There
are significant confidence intervals for both figures.  ref
name Johnson2006  /ref 

The Bobcat is believed to be evolved from the Eurasian Lynx which crossed into
North America by way of the Bering land bridge during the Pleistocene. The first
wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off
from the north by glaciers. This population evolved into modern Bobcats around
20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the
north, creating the modern Canadian Lynx. ref  /ref

/Aristotle/ /Greek/ Aristot//l//s/ /384 BC /// 322 BC/ was a Greek philosopher,
a studen

t of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great. He wrote on diverse
subjects, including phy

sics, metaphysics, poetry /including theater/, biology
and zoology, logic, rhetoric, polit

ics, government, and ethics. Along with
Socrates and Plato, Aristotle was one of the most 

influential of the ancient
Greek philosophers. They transformed Presocratic Greek philosop

hy into the
foundations of Western philosophy as we know it. Some consider Plato and
Arist

otle to have founded two of the most important schools of Ancient
philosophy/ others consi

der Aristotelianism as a development and concretization
of Plato/s insights.

Life Aristot

le was born in Stageira /Greek/ ///////////////// in Chalcidice. His
parents were Phaestis

 and Nicomachus, who became physician to King Amyntas of
Macedon. Aristotle was educated a

s a member of the aristocracy. At about the age
of eighteen, he went to Athens to continue

 his education at Plato/s Academy.
Aristotle remained at the Academy for nearly twenty yea

rs, not leaving until
after Plato/s death in 347 BC. He then traveled with Xenocrates to t

he court of
Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor. While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with
Theo

phrastus to the island of Lesbos, where together they researched the botany
and zoology of

 the island. Aristotle married Hermias/ daughter /or niece/
Pythias. She bore him a daught

er, whom they named Pythias. Soon after Hermias/
death, Aristotle was invited by Philip of

 Macedon to become tutor to Alexander
the Great.

After spending several years tutoring th

e young Alexander, Aristotle returned to
Athens. By 335 BC, he established his own school 

there, the Lyceum. Aristotle
directed courses at the Lyceum for the next twelve years. Whi

le in Athens, his
wife Pythias died. Aristotle soon became involved with Herpyllis of Stag

ira, who
bore him a son whom he named after his father, Nicomachus.

It is during this tim

e in Athens that Aristotle is thought to have composed many
of his works. Although Aristot

le wrote dialogues, only fragments of these have
survived. The works that have survived ar

e in treatise form and, for the most
part, were not meant for widespread publication. Thes

e are generally thought to
be lecture notes or texts used by his students. Among the most 

important are
