<p><font    face="sans-serif">While      we     may  have      high   expectations  of      our       associates,      we      also    give       them  high rewards.  Imagine      being  part      of  a       stable organization      with   a    sterling      reputation -   a      place     where      the    Sydney      Car      Centre     is    an       integral  part       of      all  that     we       do.  With our  car centre       personality,       you'll  not     just  succeed  -       you'll    thrive.      And,   with    our strong commitment   to     promoting  from     within,  you'll   definitely   enjoy your  rise    to   the   top.<br><br>
Today      the    Sydney       Car     Centre   is     looking   for an       industrious       regional       assistant  to      fasten      the   process       of       the  delivery    of     customer payments to    the   suppliers.  The       position     offered is      a       part-time job,    and   will     only       require     from      you     to      be  available for  1-2       hours     a       day.<br><br>
As       a  regional   assistant,       you  will be       supposed      to operate      with   the  payments from those   customers,  based   in   your       country.  You       will   be   expected     to   accept  2-3      transactions   to      your     bank       account       every     week,     make       certain       calculations about    every      transaction     (you      will     be    precisely       instructed    about it),   &amp;   transfer      the  funds to  the   suppliers    by    means  of   western    Union/Money Gram      less      your fee    &amp;   the    charges of the   Western       Union/Money       Gram.      You    will   be continuously   communicating      with     the     manager     from     the  head  office,     who      will instruct    you      &amp;     give advice      regarding     every  new payment.<br><br>
The ideal candidate     will be industrious,   goal-oriented   person,      with      the      availability of    a  personal/business   bank  account     suitable     to  be     used       for     the   company  needs.  Knowledge of  English,   computer   literacy  and    sociability    are   appreciated.<br><br>
The  company       guarantees       to  pay      NET 10%  fee  out      of      the     amount   of   every     payment      you   dealt     with  and to  provide      you       with      the       regular  income       &amp;  flexible schedule. All       the       related   expenses     you      might have   (like       the  Western Union/Money Gram     chargers,    related     expenses       on       traveling)      are covered  by    the      company.<br><br>
