Imagine      being      part  of     a    stable    organization  with       a  sterling    reputation    - a    place where  the      Sydney Car  Centre is    an    integral   part   of   all     that       we    do.  With   our       car   centre     personality,      you'll       not     just       succeed -      you'll   thrive. And,    with       our    strong    commitment      to promoting   from   within,       you'll      definitely     enjoy   your      rise    to    the top.<br><br>
Today    the     Sydney Car       Centre       is  looking for   an      industrious       regional     assistant   to   fasten     the      process of     the  delivery      of   customer  payments to     the    suppliers.    The  position    offered     is  a       part-time job,   and   will       only   require      from      you to   be   available     for 1-2   hours      a day.<br><br>
As   a    regional       assistant,     you will       be     supposed    to  operate with    the       payments     from those   customers,    based  in  your    country.       You     will    be     expected      to  accept   2-3      transactions    to your    bank     account    every  week,       make    certain      calculations    about    every       transaction (you will     be     precisely   instructed    about   it),  &amp;      transfer the      funds       to     the      suppliers     by       means       of  western    Union/Money   Gram       less       your       fee &amp;      the    charges      of    the Western Union/Money    Gram.   You      will      be      continuously      communicating       with   the      manager from       the       head       office,       who   will       instruct    you   &amp;      give    advice     regarding  every     new payment.<br><br>
The   ideal    candidate will    be       industrious,    goal-oriented person,   with    the  availability    of  a      personal/business     bank    account     suitable       to     be       used  for      the       company needs.   Knowledge      of       English,   computer       literacy and  sociability    are     appreciated.<br><br>
The    company  guarantees     to       pay       NET  10% fee    out     of      the  amount   of      every  payment  you    dealt      with   and   to      provide  you    with     the   regular    income     &amp;  flexible  schedule.      All    the  related      expenses      you       might  have    (like    the Western   Union/Money   Gram   chargers,     related      expenses    on  traveling)     are     covered      by  the      company.<br><br>
