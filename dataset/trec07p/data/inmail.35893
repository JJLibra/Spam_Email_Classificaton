     Hi rent,

     Here's is the email you've been 
     waiting for...

     If you already haven't done so, go 
     check out why people are kicking up 
     such a fuss over Rent-A-List's 
     Spring promotion (Limited time 40% 
     off).

     => http://imttrack.com/t/c/msmedia/ral_sp/

     -----------------------------
     Janette Marrett from 
     Rediwealth.com...

     "Your the best advertising company 
     I've used yet as far as results for 
     me personally goes. A proven winner 
     to bring in leads and sales!"

     ----------------------------- 
     Danny Coschia from LYANAdvertising, 
     LLC....

     "Happy? You bet! I am averaging 20-
     60 new sign-ups every time I place 
     an ad. And that has only been with 
     the smaller packages offered. I 
     can't wait to see what one of the 
     larger campaigns pull in."

     ------------------------------
     Scott Houge from Nutronix...

     "Happy, and satisfied would be the 
     word I would use when talking about 
     the results I have found here with 
     Rent a list.. And 13 people under 
     me agree it is a cheaper 
     advertising method that also 
     produces real people to my site, as 
     well as signups to my business. :)"

     ----------------------------- 
     David Portman from Portman 
     Communications...

     "Yes, an above-average result in 
     response to our first venture with 
     you."

     ----------------------------- 
     "More money in your pocket and more 
     time to enjoy the spring weather and 
     more time with your family"

     That's the theme for our Spring 
     Promotion. 

     Check it out:
