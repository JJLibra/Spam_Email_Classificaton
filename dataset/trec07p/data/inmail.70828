<=21--WASHINGTON - The Senate resurrected the immigration bill that could legalize mill=
ions of unlawful immigrants Tuesday, but the delicate compromise faces the same threats t=
hat derailed it earlier this month.=20

ADVERTISEMENT
=20
The White House and Republican and Democratic architects of the bill hailed the crucial te=
st vote that revived the legislation, and they predicted approval of the measure by week's=
 end.

Their victory was fleeting, though, giving way just hours later to stalling tactics by GOP=
 foes. Conservatives succeeded in delaying until Wednesday consideration of a package of=
 amendments designed to pave the way for a final vote on the bill.

They did so by using Senate rules to insist that the entire 373-page package be read aloud, r=
elenting only when Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., agreed to postpone action on the am=
endments.

That was just the first in a series of formidable obstacles lying in the bill's path. The Sen=
ate is slated to consider 26 amendments, mostly from senators seeking to change key elemen=
ts of the bill, that have the potential to either sap its support or draw new backers.

After that, the legislation must overcome another make-or-break vote as early as Thursda=
y. And there is no guarantee that it will ultimately attract enough support to pass.

Republicans and Democrats alike are deeply conflicted over the bill, which also would cre=
ate a temporary worker program, strengthen border security and institute a new system for=
 weeding out illegal immigrants from workplaces.

Masking those divides, the Senate voted 64-35 to revive the bill, which stalled earlier th=
is month when it failed to muster the 60 votes it needed to scale procedural hurdles.

Twenty-four Republicans joined 39 Democrats and independent Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of=
 Connecticut to move ahead with the bill. Opposing the move were 25 Republicans, nine Democ=
rats and independent Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont.

Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the lead Democratic negotiator on the bill, call=
ed the vote =22a major step forward for our national security, for our economy and for our hu=
manity.=22

=22We did the right thing today because we know the American people sent us here to act on our=
 most urgent problems. We know they will not stand for small political factions getting in t=
he way,=22 Kennedy said.

On the other side, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said opponents of amnesty for illegal immig=
rants are being told they must vote for the bill anyway =22because that's the only way we're=
 going to create a legal system of immigration in America.=22

Under the bill, he said, =22we're not going to get any substantial reduction in illegality=
, we're going to double illegality.=22

President Bush and his team were working intensely to rally support for the measure.

=22It's a careful compromise,=22 the president told business leaders and representativ=
es of religious, Hispanic and agricultural communities. He said, =22In a good piece of leg=
islation like this, and a difficult piece of legislation like this, one side doesn't get ev=
erything they want.=22

Bush was working the phones to drum up backers, said Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez,=
 who with Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff was also lobbying senators.

Tuesday's vote suggested that key senators and White House officials had succeeded =
=E2=80=94 at least for now =E2=80=94 in bargaining with skeptical lawmakers for a second c=
hance to pass the bill. Several senators who have been promised votes on their amendments,=
 including Sens. Kit Bond, R-Mo., Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Norm Coleman, R-Minn., Pete Do=
menici, R-N.M., John Ensign, R-Nev., and Jim Webb, D-Va., supported moving ahead with the=
 measure, after siding with opponents earlier this month on the test vote that stalled it.

Less clear was whether that support would hold. At least one Democrat who backed reviving t=
he bill, Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, publicly said he could not guarantee he would v=
ote later to end debate and move to final passage.=20

Menendez is pushing for passage of his amendment to award more points in a new merit-based g=
reen card allocation system for family ties to U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents=
=2E=20

Several of the Republican amendments slated for Senate votes would make the bill tougher o=
n unlawful immigrants, while those by Democrats would make it easier on those seeking to im=
migrate legally based solely on family ties.=20

Likely to be among the first voted on is a proposal by Sen. Kay Baily Hutchison, R-Texas, to r=
equire all adult illegal immigrants to return home before gaining permanent lawful statu=
s. The bill would require only heads of households seeking green cards to do so.=20
