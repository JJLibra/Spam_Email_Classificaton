<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, ever since we started working together almo=

 take a dramatic turn for the better and bring you the kinds of things you h=

erday, when I was going over some charts, I saw an incredible gathering of g=
ood fortune starting on  June 8th, 2007.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, knowing you for almost 2 months, I und=
erstand how Leos can be somewhat skeptical and have a tendency to put things=
 off, so I knew I had to show you why you should use this opportunity and ma=
ke sure you act quickly, so you would not let it slip through your fingers, =
only to regret it later.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is exactly =
why I'm writing.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know someone who is an expert in the field of magi=
c and he has an incredible kit with truly magical items that can draw and ma=
gnify this luck and good fortune to you. What's more, he's someone who compl=
etely understands the mind and character of  Leos so you should really benef=
it from his knowledge.<BR><FONT face=3D"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-seri=

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This remarkable man's name is Bernard, and his knowl=

sp;&nbsp;Please examine and test your "Good Luck" kit completely at our Risk=
!<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a month, two months or up to one year -- 365 da=
ys -- to try out your "Good Luck" kit. If you are not 110% satisfied with it=
, or if you feel it didn't attract the luck and good fortune I said it would=
, or even if you just change your mind, just return your kit to either mysel=
f or Rochelle and I will make sure you get a complete refund, including the =
cost of shipping and handling...immediately.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to brag or boast, but only an expert like myself=
 would ever put together such a powerful collection of tools that have the p=
ower to attract the kind of good fortune that is now in the stars for Leos. =
This is the kind of good fortune that can change your destiny, I might add.<=
BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, these kits are not available in stor=
es, which is one of the reasons Rochelle contacted me and I contacted you. T=
he other reason is...they work!<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please see wh=
at they can do for you...since you have nothing to lose and everything to ga=
in.<BR></FONT></P>
