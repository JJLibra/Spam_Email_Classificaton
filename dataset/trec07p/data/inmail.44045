   Nathaniels face flushed in a relief which died quickly down to a sombre hopelessness. He faced his uncle doggedly. Not much, Uncle Jehiel! he said heavily. I aint agoin to hear to such a thing. I know all about your wantin to get away from the valley -- you take that money and go yourself and Ill --

   A penetrating cold wind swept around the corner and he turned to go inside to see about the steam-pipes. In the outer hall he noticed that the service had progressed to the responsive readings. As he opened the door of the church the minister read rapidly, Praised be the Lord who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.
