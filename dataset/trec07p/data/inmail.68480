Imagine    being     part    of  a     stable   organization   with      a      sterling     reputation      -    a      place    where the Sydney       Car    Centre is     an   integral     part     of    all      that     we      do.       With       our   car      centre       personality,   you'll      not    just      succeed      -       you'll      thrive. And, with     our    strong  commitment      to  promoting      from      within,   you'll    definitely   enjoy  your      rise       to     the    top.<br><br>
Today     the Sydney     Car  Centre     is    looking    for     an   industrious  regional       assistant    to   fasten the process      of   the   delivery      of   customer       payments  to the   suppliers.      The       position       offered  is a     part-time job,    and   will   only require     from    you  to    be available   for       1-2   hours      a    day.<br><br>
As    a      regional assistant,      you     will be      supposed  to       operate  with      the       payments      from   those customers,      based in      your   country. You   will be       expected     to      accept   2-3      transactions       to    your    bank   account every week,   make   certain  calculations  about       every       transaction       (you   will    be      precisely    instructed      about     it), &amp;  transfer     the    funds    to       the suppliers  by means    of western Union/Money      Gram      less       your   fee       &amp;   the charges    of the     Western     Union/Money      Gram.  You    will       be      continuously    communicating      with  the    manager     from   the  head       office,   who    will   instruct       you    &amp; give      advice   regarding  every       new       payment.<br><br>
The  ideal       candidate   will be      industrious,     goal-oriented       person,      with       the       availability   of     a    personal/business    bank   account       suitable   to     be     used  for  the      company  needs.     Knowledge  of    English,   computer literacy    and     sociability    are     appreciated.<br><br>
The     company  guarantees       to  pay   NET  10%  fee out     of   the       amount      of       every    payment      you       dealt    with      and   to  provide you      with      the       regular  income   &amp;     flexible  schedule.   All    the   related    expenses       you  might      have    (like    the     Western Union/Money       Gram chargers,     related     expenses  on      traveling)      are   covered    by    the       company.<br><br>
