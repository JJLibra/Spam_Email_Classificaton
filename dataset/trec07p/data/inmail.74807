gay slur he uttered heard 'round the world will be the very
last time he speaks publicly about the controversy! Isaiah
tells Showbiz Tonight's A.J. Hammer "It was horrible. I'm
saddened and after today, I will shut up....I'm not talking
about it ever again."
About how he felt after being fired, Isaiah chokes up and
says "I felt like I had been humiliated, chastised, and put in
my place." Isaiah also lashes out at former castmate T.R.
Knight, who went public with the fact that he was gay after the
first reports about what Isaiah said. Says Isiah:"I couldn't
believe that he tried to throw me under the bus that way. This
man straight lied."
And there's a lot more.This is the interview everyone will
be talking about. It's a <B>Showbiz Special Event: Isaiah Tells
