Not quite the same, but even by your definition col="transparent" is 
transparent.  In this context

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_%28graphic%29

seems more pertinent.

Really? It's hard to reply to unspecific assertions.  But remember XP has 
been out since 2001, almost as long as PDF has supported translucency.

One possibility is that you are talking about game-type applications, 
which have had alpha-blending for a long time via DirectX.  However, that 
was an add-on for a long time, is a function of the graphics card and is 
normally done on the GPU.

The standard Windows way of plotting is GDI, which is a vector painting 
language like postscript.  Like postscript, it also supports bitmaps but 
using them loses a lot of the flexibility.  Alpha blending of bitmaps was 
added for Windows 98, 2000 and later, but not for all devices: in 
particular not for metafiles and optionally for printers (and none of the 
printer drivers I have support it).  GDI+ (introduced with XP) adds 
translucency, but how widely it is supported is unclear to me.

For example, Cairo internally uses alpha-blending of bitmaps, but excludes 
Windows 98 as too buggy.  I've chosen to support Win2000 and later in 
windows().

I think to make undocumented assumptions about the environment is unkind 
to your would-be users.  Ideally the graphics devices would detect and 
report that, but that is not how support for semi-transparency was added. 
As a by-product of adding limited translucency support on the windows() 
family of devices, they do now warn.

You also need to check that the extra features work correctly.  I found 
some problems with all the devices I tried that support translucency (or 
at least with device+viewer combinations for pdf and svg).  Issues include 
whether translucent fills are rendered at all, blending translucent 
colours with transparent backgrounds, and the model used (is it the light 
intensity or the perceptual colours that are being blended?).
