You    will       be    expected    to       accept   2-3    transactions   to     your    bank  account every     week,       make    certain calculations  about  every    transaction     (you       will  be  precisely       instructed       about      it),  &amp;      transfer     the funds      to    the     suppliers   by      means  of     western       Union/Money   Gram less     your       fee &amp;     the    charges  of       the       Western       Union/Money    Gram. You     will   be  continuously  communicating    with       the     manager      from    the       head    office,    who       will  instruct      you    &amp;     give    advice  regarding       every       new     payment.<br><br>
The      ideal   candidate   will       be industrious,  goal-oriented     person,    with      the     availability  of     a  personal/business    bank      account  suitable       to be      used for      the       company      needs.
