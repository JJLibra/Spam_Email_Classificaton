<P><FONT face=3D"Courier New" color=3Dblack size=3D2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care to hum along?&nbsp; It's good for you!&nbsp; I'=
m talking about &quot;toning,&quot; which is simply vocalizing a vowel sound=
, like someone chanting &quot;om.&quot;&nbsp; Actually, you've been &quot;to=
ning&quot; all your life, probably without realizing it.&nbsp; Every time yo=
u may happen to groan, or sigh, or laugh, or say &quot;ahhh&quot; or &quot;o=
w&quot; produces the sound called toning.&nbsp; These are all unconscious re=
actions.&nbsp; And these sounds we produce through the body help remove tens=
ion and pain, and release pent-up energy, and re-establish a natural flow, l=
eaving the body feeling more calm and cleansed.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you vocalize a sound, Memo, it creates a vib=
ration in the body that acts almost like a massage on the bones, tissues, ce=
lls, and fluids of the body.&nbsp; The vibration has a big effect on the neu=
rological and endocrine systems.&nbsp; This is because the hypothalamus and =
pituitary gland are close to the roof of the mouth, and the vibration from t=
oning acts on them to release chemical hormones throughout the body.&nbsp; T=
his in turn helps with improved immune function, increased brain hemisphere =
balance, and stimulates the &quot;rest-and-repair&quot; function of the nerv=
ous system.&nbsp; That's a lot of good from just a little sound!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's what you do.&nbsp; And toning is something=
 that is easy to work into your day.&nbsp; You can do it when driving, or in=
 the shower, or resting at home.&nbsp; Here's what you can do.&nbsp; You'll =
be using the vowel sounds &#150; A, E, I, O, U.&nbsp; Take a deep breath, an=
d as you exhale, start with the &quot;A&quot; sound.&nbsp; As you exhale, ch=
ant the &quot;A&quot; sound.&nbsp; Then inhale another deep breath, and exha=
le again chanting the &quot;A.&quot;&nbsp; Do this about 5 times for each vo=
wel.&nbsp; You can always increase the number of times you repeat them.&nbsp=
; After all, you may be feeling so good that you don't want to stop!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy humming!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be wise to listen carefully to what your bo=
dy is telling you it needs today.  It may be something major, like meditatio=
n, or simple, like a different hairstyle or outfit.
<BR>
<BR>





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You generally have a calm, positive outlook and now =
approach most of your affairs the same way.  You enjoy life when things go w=
ell and people around you get along.  You can take time to relax now.







<BR>
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to romance, it will be so easy that yo=
u'll either be passing out numbers - like at the deli - or collecting them o=
n cocktail napkins.  Either way, you can afford to be picky.
