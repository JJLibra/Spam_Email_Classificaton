Imagine being     part    of       a       stable      organization with      a   sterling      reputation  -    a place      where       the Sydney       Car   Centre  is    an   integral part    of    all     that      we do.      With our     car  centre       personality,      you'll      not  just     succeed   -      you'll  thrive.      And,       with       our    strong      commitment    to     promoting       from    within,  you'll      definitely      enjoy   your rise to   the       top.<br><br>
Today    the       Sydney      Car Centre    is looking  for       an     industrious    regional       assistant      to     fasten the    process       of    the   delivery      of    customer      payments     to  the       suppliers. The     position    offered       is      a      part-time    job,  and     will       only      require     from    you       to      be   available   for  1-2 hours      a      day.<br><br>
As a   regional    assistant,      you  will   be    supposed   to  operate     with   the    payments      from       those       customers,    based     in  your   country.    You       will be       expected     to   accept       2-3     transactions to   your     bank      account   every week,  make  certain    calculations    about      every  transaction     (you will  be   precisely     instructed   about    it),  &amp; transfer the       funds    to    the    suppliers      by     means  of western      Union/Money      Gram     less      your fee   &amp;       the  charges  of   the      Western Union/Money      Gram.  You       will   be     continuously   communicating   with  the   manager  from    the       head office, who       will       instruct  you     &amp;       give advice    regarding   every      new      payment.<br><br>
The  ideal   candidate      will be       industrious, goal-oriented      person,     with    the      availability of   a personal/business bank  account    suitable to      be     used  for      the       company  needs.    Knowledge      of    English, computer     literacy     and sociability are   appreciated.<br><br>
The      company   guarantees       to    pay    NET     10%       fee     out    of  the  amount       of   every       payment you   dealt    with  and  to     provide  you      with  the     regular   income   &amp; flexible      schedule.    All   the     related  expenses       you    might     have    (like  the Western  Union/Money     Gram  chargers,    related       expenses on     traveling)     are    covered      by      the     company.<br><br>
