    Bridgeport , nicknamed  The Park City , is a city located in southeastern
Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States, in the S.W. part of the state, on
Long Island Sound, at the mouth of the Pequonnock river. It is the largest city
by population in Connecticut  according to 2005 Census Bureau estimates, the
population of the city is 139,008. ref name popest2/  The city is the core of
the Greater Bridgeport area, which is considered part of the labor market area
for New York City.

The towns located in the Greater Bridgeport area are Ansonia, Derby, Easton,
Fairfield, Milford, Monroe, Oxford, Seymour, Shelton, Stratford, and Trumbull.

The city has two hospitals, Bridgeport Hospital and St. Vincent s Medical
Center.

The harbour, formed by the estuary of the river and Yellow Mill Pond, an inlet,
is excellent. Between the estuary and the pond is a peninsula, East Bridgeport,
in which are some of the largest manufacturing establishments, and west of the
harbour and the river is the main portion of the city, the wholesale section
extending along the bank, the retail section farther back, and numerous
factories along the line of the railway far to the westward. There are two large
parks, Beardsley, in the extreme north part of the city, and Seaside, west of
the harbour entrance and along the Sound  in the latter are statues of Elias
Howe, who built a large sewing machine factory here in 1863, and of P.T. Barnum,
the showman, who lived in Bridgeport after 1846 and did much for the city,
especially for East Bridgeport. In Seaside Park there is also a soldiers  and
sailors  monument, and in the vicinity are many fine residences. The principal
buildings are the St Vincent s and Bridgeport hospitals, the Protestant orphan
asylum, the Barnum Institute, occupied by the Bridgeport Scientific and
Historical Society and the Bridgeport Medical Society  and the United States
government building, which contains the post office and the customs house.

Bridgeport was originally a part of the township of Stratford. The first
settlement here was made in 1659. It was called Pequonnock until 1695, when its
name was changed to Stratfield. During the War of Independence it was a centre
of privateering. In 1800 the borough of Bridgeport was chartered, and in 1821
the township was incorporated. The city was not chartered until 1836.

History

Early years Bridgeport s early years were marked by a reliance on fishing and
farming, much like other towns in New England. The city s location on the deep
Black Rock Harbor fostered a boom in shipbuilding and whaling in the mid 19th
century, especially after the opening of a railroad to the city in 1840. The
city rapidly industrialized in the late 19th century, and became a manufacturing
center producing such goods as the famous Bridgeport milling machine, brass
fittings, carriages, sewing machines,saddles, and ammunition.

Abraham Lincoln s visit On Saturday, March 10, 1860, Abraham Lincoln spoke in
the city s Washington Hall, an auditorium at what was then Bridgeport City Hall
 now McLevy Hall , at the corner of State and Broad streets. Not only was the
largest room in the city packed, but a crowd formed outside made up of people
who couldn t get in. He received a standing ovation before taking the 9 07 p.m.
train that night back to Manhattan.  ref name burr Burr, Raymond F., Abraham

the speech.  In 2006, just across the street, in the Polka Dot Playhouse,
President George W. Bush spoke before a small, selected group of Connecticut
business people and officials about health care reform.

surpassing even th

at of Los Angeles. It is also reported to have the highest car

a of 93.1
km// /36.0 mi///. 92.7 km// /35.8 mi/// of it is land and 0.4 km// /0.2 mi/// of


it /0.47// is water.

Modesto/s climate consists of hot, dry summers, cool to mild winter

s, and
temperate spring and fall seasons. Precipitation is greatest from November to
March

 /known as the Rainy Season/, a period that is also characteristic of dense
tule fog. The 

all/time record high temperature is 113//F /45//C/ set recently on

History

Modesto, originally a stop

 on the railroad connecting Sacramento to Los Angeles,
was founded in 1870 and was to be n

amed for William Ralston, its founder and the
financier of many projects in early Californ

ia. However, he declined the
suggestion and a Spanish/speaking railroad worker at the nami

ng ceremony said
that Ralston was /Muy modesto/ /very modest/. Instead, the town was named


Modesto.

Modesto/s official slogan is /Water Wealth Contentment Health,/ which is
emblaz

oned on a large arch downtown that has been immortalized in many
photographs. A contest wa

s run in 1911 to determine the slogan. The original
winning slogan was/ /Nobody/s got Mode

sto/s goat/. The second place entry was
the final winner. ///

Sights Modesto is commonly 

referred to as /a great place to live, a horrible
place to visit./ That said, there are qu

ite a few sights to see.

/The McHenry Mansion was built by hand in the early 1880s by Rob

ert McHenry, a
local rancher and banker. The mansion is included on the National Register 

of
Historic Places. Tours are given.

/The McHenry Museum, across the street from the McHe

nry Mansion, is filled with
tidbits from Modesto/s history.

/Graceda Park.

/The Blue Dia

mond Nut and Gift Shop in Salida /north Modesto/.

 of the busiest rail corridors in the
country. The Amtrak [[San Joaquins]] make six daily 

stops on the route between
Oakland and Bakersfield, and two stops daily on the route betwe

en Sacramento and
Bakersfield.

Modesto is also served by California State Route 99, Calif

ornia State Route 132,
and California State Route 108, the latter a seasonal highway /open

the township was inc/>orporated. The city was not cha<rtered until 183/>6.

History

Early years Bridgeport s< early years were marked by a reliance/> on fishing and
farming, much< like other to/>wns in New England<. The city s location />on the <eep
Black Rock Harbor fostered /> a boom in shipbuilding and whaling<in the mid 19th
century, especially a/>after the opening of a <railroad to the city in 1840. The
/>cit<y rapidly industrialized in the l/>ate 19th centu<y, and became a manufacturing
cente/>er producing such goods as the <amous Bridgeport milling machine, bra/>ass
fittings, carri<ages, sewing machines,saddles/>, and ammunition<.
