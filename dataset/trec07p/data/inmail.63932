   The  horse   Equus caballus, sometimes seen as a subspecies of the Wild
Horse, Equus ferus caballus  is a large odd toed ungulate mammal, one of ten
modern species of the genus [[Equidae/Equus]]. Horses have long been among the
most economically important domesticated animals  although their importance has
declined with mechanization, they are still found worldwide, fitting into human
lives in various ways. The horse is prominent in religion, mythology, and art 
it has played an important role in transportation, agriculture, and war  it has
additionally served as a source of food, fuel, and clothing.

Almost all breeds of horses can, at least in theory, carry humans on their backs
or be harnessed to pull objects such as carts or plows. However, horse breeds
were developed to allow horses to be specialized for certain task  lighter
horses for racing or riding, heavier horses for farming and other tasks
requiring pulling power. In some societies, horses are a source of food, both
meat and milk  in others it is taboo to consume them. In industrialized
countries horses are predominantly kept for leisure and sporting pursuits, while
they are still used as working animals in many other parts of the world.

Age Depending on breed, management and environment, the domestic horse today has
a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years. It is uncommon, but a few horses live into
their 40s, and, occasionally, beyond. The oldest verifiable record was  Old
Billy,  a horse that lived in the 19th century to the age of 62. ref
name  horsefacts  [http   www.fbresearch.org HorseFacts Facts  The Mane Facts
About Horse Health] URL accessed January 22, 2007.  ref  In modern times, Sugar
Puff, who had been listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world s
oldest then living pony, died at age 56. ref Ryder, Erin.  World s Oldest Living

Regardless of a horse s actual birthdate, for most competition purposes, horses
are considered a year older on January 1 of each year in the northern hemisphere
and July 1 in the southern hemisphere. The exception is endurance riding, where
the minimum age to compete is based on the horse s actual calendar age.

The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages   Foal  a
horse of either sex less than one year old. A nursing foal is sometimes called a
suckling and a foal that has been weaned is called a weanling. Most domesticated
foals are weaned at 4 6 months of age.  Yearling  a horse of either sex that is
between one and two years old.  Colt  a male horse under the age of four.
 Filly  a female horse under the age of four.  Mare  a female horse four years
old and older.  Stallion  a non castrated male horse four years old and older.
Some people, particularly in the UK, refer to a stallion as a  horse.   Gelding 
A castrated male horse of any age, though for convenience sake, many people also
refer to a young gelding under the age of four as a  colt. 

In horse racing the definitions of colt, filly, mare, and stallion or horse may
differ from those given above. In the United Kingdom, Thoroughbred horse racing
defines a  colt  as a male horse less than five years old and a filly as a
female horse less than five years old. In the USA, both Thoroughbred racing and
harness racing defines colts and fillies as four years old and younger. ref [http   www.equibase.com newfan glossary

A very rough estimate of a horse s age can be made from looking at its teeth.

Size The size of horses varies by breed, but can also be influenced by
nutrition. The general rule for cutoff in height between what is considered a
horse and a pony at maturity is 14.2 hands high.  abbreviated  h  or  hh    147
cm, 58 inches  as measured at the withers. An animal 14.2h or over is usually
considered a horse and one less than 14.2h is a pony.

However, there are exceptions to the general rule. Some smaller horse breeds who
typically produce individual horses both under and over 14.2h are considered
 horses  regardless of height. Likewise, some pony breeds, such as the Pony of
the Americas or the Welsh pony, share some features of horses and individual
animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2h, but are still considered ponies.

The difference between a horse and pony is not simply a height difference, but
also a difference in [[phenotype]] or appearance. There are noticeable
differences in conformation and temperament. Ponies often exhibit thicker manes,
tails and overall coat. They also have proportionally shorter legs, wider
barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad
foreheads. They often have calmer temperaments than horses and also a h</STYLE>
