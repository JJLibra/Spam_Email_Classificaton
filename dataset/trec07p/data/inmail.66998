EntreMetrix Pursues China Joint Venture Alliance for Advanced Nitride
Monday June 25, 9:00 am ET 


IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EntreMetrix, Inc. (OTCBB:ERMX - News) today discussed the pursuit of a joint manufacturing alliance in China for Advanced Nitride Devices. The joint venture plan calls for a China-based alliance partner to invest in the building of a wafer production operation to serve the larger semiconductor device manufacturing community in China.

Discussing the alliances under consideration for Advanced Nitride EntreMetrix CEO Scott W. Absher stated that "concern for more balanced trade between the US and China has encouraged an investment interest by China in joint ventures with US-based companies to develop technologies to be manufactured in China. The development of a joint manufacturing venture to produce Gallium Nitride (GaN) semiconductor technology under Advanced Nitride Devices makes a great deal of sense at this time. Clearly the manufacturing influence in China and the quest to pursue next-generation technologies using Gallium Nitride technology offer enormous opportunity."

The evaluation process has begun and is expected to produce an alliance partner by Q4 of 2007.
