The Leonardian Library in Vinci, Tuscany, is making the Madrid Codices and the Codex Atlanticus -- two collections of scientific and technical drawings -- available as a free digital archive called e-Leo.  

The cells operate at a relatively low temperature of 600C or less. The scientists say this is the highest output power density ever achieved for such a low temperature fuel cell.huh ? six hunred degrees celsius is low ?? since when? 

Nonetheless, there are plenty of curiosities for the lay reader. 

THESAURUS 

Despite his protests, he is unquestioningly trying to fuel the fire, he is posting nonsense about the browser, and it's hard to avoid the conclusion that he bothers to spout this ignorant waffle because of mindless and personal hate for Safari. It probably laughed at him in school or something.

Mondial Energy, meanwhile, has also promoted solar thermal water heaters in Canada. These trap heat from the sun and use it to heat water. The solar water heaters may not generate all of the energy required to heat the water, but can take care of a substantial percentage. Mondial has put solar thermal systems in laundromats and retirement homes, and is exploring installing some in hotels in the U.S., said Mondial President Alex Winch. As someone that has spent days hanging around in the weird world of “Phone-Hold” listening to non-soothing classical music, this was as refreshing as it was unsettling. I like what Dell has done on that site and it does seem that customer feedback is fuelling certain real-world changes. However, I can’t actually bring myself to believe that we are seeing the start of something great: caring, responsive companies that want what’s best for us. I’ll believe the fluffier, cuddly PR spin when it translates into short, productive customer support cal!

Well we know this was not created by a Republican conservative like me. No it was created by a touchy feely bleeding heart liberal who wants to spread his/her message of tolerance and love. Like the stupid Ad Council we have in the USA.

Noise problems are typically complex and multifaceted, and as our acoustic consultant told us, sound is like water: block it from traveling along one path, and it will simply find another. 
Today, you can’t turn around without one or another PC/computer maker apologising for its conduct. Apple, Dell, Sony, Toshiba, Gateway etc. etc. etc. OK, when it comes to lots of recalled notebook batteries and gunfights in a virtual version Manchester Cathedral, you can expect the odd apology but these days, apologies are as common as raindrops. That said, are they changing the service you get on the end of your telephone? In my experience, so far, no. The companies are seemingly more open and more responsive to customers – at least in the media – but on the front line of frustrated users at home in their living rooms, staring at faulty kit and hanging endlessly on the line, I fear it’s the same old rubbish. 

Low temperature of 600 degrees!? If my memory serves me well that's something like temperature of flame over the oven... I can almost see through the eyes of imagination, those headlines in 2010 or so: "Sony recalls exploding fuel cells"...
