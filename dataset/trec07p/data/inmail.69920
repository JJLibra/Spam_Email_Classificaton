<P>Dear Memo,&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Bethea has been working w=
ith you and I also sense that you are due for a miracle. It is my honor to b=
e the person who can help you find it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreams, YOUR dreams, are meant to com=
e true. There is no dream or wish too big or too unlikely to happen. It is a=
ll within your grasp; the wealth you have wished for, the happiness you have=
 prayed for, the love and luck you have always imagined for yourself. That's=
 why you cannot afford to miss this chance!<B>&nbsp;</B></P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>It is time for some good luck and I know where<BR>and h=
ow to find it</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, I know intuitively that you hav=
e felt real pain, sadness and disappointment. I know how hard it is to belie=
ve that things will ever change, that the sun will ever come out in your dar=
kened, cloud-filled sky, that things will ever really turn around for you, b=
ut I am here to tell you that it can and will.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Leap over your barriers to wealth and happiness</B><B>&=
nbsp;</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is, the very pain you have =
known may well be what blocks you from crossing over into the wealth, happin=
ess and joy that you <I>deserve</I>. But it doesn't have to.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why I feel I must tell you thi=
s amazing story about miracles.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>How Lourdes' history can happily change your future</B>=
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, you may well have already heard=
 about Lourdes, a town in France, and of the events in the mid-19th century =
that have transformed it into one of the most important places of emotional,=
 spiritual, and physical healing in the world.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1858, a French peasant girl named =
Bernadette Soubirous, while going about her simple life, received the blessi=
ng of a vision of the Virgin Mary.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, where young Bernadette saw t=
he beautiful woman in the grotto, her unbelieving neighbors could only see b=
arren rock, the innocent child was able to see by the light of love and fait=
h what was hidden in the darkness of others' minds. &nbsp; What followed wer=
e an astonishing series of miracles, when the Holy Virgin could be seen as w=
ell as the miraculous creation of a limitless spring of water from an arid r=
ock.</P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bernadette&rsquo;s worth wa=
s not valued. All around her were skeptics and non-believers. She was mocked=
 and diminished and did not receive the seriousness she knew she deserved.</=
P>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now tell me, Memo, is this a fe=
eling that sounds sadly familiar?</p>
						<p align=3D"center"><b>July 16th was a miraculous and powerful date th=
en and can be one for you NOW</b></p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The date of July 16th was the=
 eighteenth and last appearance of the Holy Virgin to Bernadette. This day, =
although her way to the grotto was blocked by a barrier, the call of the Vir=
gin could not be denied.  Bernadette arrived at the grotto by way of the str=
eam called Gave, her destination when she saw the first apparition.</p>
						<p align=3D"center"><b>Bernadette at last got what she needed and so c=
an you!</b></p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only after this date tha=
t Bernadette was finally empowered, respected and trusted. It was on this da=
te that she received the validation of those around her.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the Virgin Mary spoke =
to Bernadette, all doubts about her visions were then laid to rest.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new belief in herself went=
 on to change her life and also to change the world.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this miracle, even more p=
eople flocked to the quiet town of Lourdes to witness and experience for the=
mselves the prophesies, countless healing miracles, and life-altering transf=
ormations of this special place.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For over 150 years, the name of=
 the small town of Lourdes and its spring have been synonymous with miraculo=
us healings.</p>
						<P align=3Dcenter><B>Now the world-renowned healing spirit of Lourdes =
can come to you</B></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, I can actually tell you h=
ow to bring the spirit of the Lourdes miracles right into your home and into=
 your life and the lives of your loved ones, to help bring about astonishing=
 changes, sensational opportunities and unforeseen joy!</P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you can make this pilgrimag=
e without leaving home. Because I have found for you your very own <B>Miracu=
lous Cross of Lourdes</B>!<B> </B></P>
