friends in your country for help I am Mrs. Joy. Kokou from
Ivory Coast. I am a widow being that I lost myhusband a
couple of months ago.

My husband was a serving director of the Cocoa exporting
board until his death .He was ass assinated last january
by the rebels following the political uprising. Before his
death he had a foreign account here in ABIDJAN COTE
D'IVOIREup to the tune of $6.5M which he told the bank was
for the importation of cocoa processing machine. I want
you to do me a favour to receive this funds to a safe
account in your country or any safer place as the
beneficiary . I have plans to do investment in your
country, like real estate and industrial production.
