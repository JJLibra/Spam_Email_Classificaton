Imagine      being  part      of      a stable       organization   with a       sterling     reputation    -  a    place      where     the Sydney      Car  Centre  is      an     integral      part  of all       that      we    do.   With      our car      centre  personality,    you'll  not  just succeed      -       you'll   thrive.     And,      with  our  strong  commitment to   promoting   from     within,   you'll definitely     enjoy   your  rise   to      the top.<br><br>
Today the  Sydney    Car       Centre is     looking  for   an     industrious    regional  assistant  to   fasten    the      process   of     the      delivery   of    customer      payments    to     the    suppliers.

As   a       regional    assistant,      you   will    be supposed      to    operate      with   the  payments  from    those  customers,    based     in     your country. You  will be      expected to  accept     2-3    transactions      to     your      bank account       every    week,     make    certain    calculations     about   every  transaction      (you  will    be     precisely    instructed       about    it),  &amp;   transfer    the      funds       to    the   suppliers    by       means  of   western   Union/Money       Gram     less   your   fee     &amp;     the  charges    of the    Western       Union/Money  Gram.  You will      be      continuously    communicating   with    the   manager      from       the       head     office,   who     will       instruct   you     &amp;  give advice regarding     every new      payment.<br><br>
The  ideal      candidate   will   be industrious, goal-oriented    person, with   the   availability  of    a personal/business bank     account   suitable     to be  used       for       the       company  needs.

All       the       related    expenses      you       might     have  (like    the Western  Union/Money   Gram  chargers,    related    expenses   on   traveling)       are  covered  by       the  company.<br><br>
