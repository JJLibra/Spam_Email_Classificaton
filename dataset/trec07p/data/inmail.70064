<p><font face="sans-serif">While       we   may    have    high     expectations   of      our       associates,       we also    give   them      high       rewards.     Imagine  being part  of   a  stable  organization  with a      sterling       reputation      -     a place  where       the Sydney    Car    Centre  is  an       integral part  of  all     that  we  do.       With    our     car centre     personality, you'll      not     just       succeed      -    you'll      thrive.   And,  with   our strong      commitment  to      promoting       from  within, you'll     definitely     enjoy     your       rise     to the    top.<br><br>
Today the Sydney       Car Centre    is     looking   for     an      industrious    regional  assistant    to     fasten   the process    of       the   delivery   of   customer      payments     to     the       suppliers.  The      position    offered       is      a  part-time     job,     and      will     only    require   from you     to be       available      for       1-2     hours       a      day.<br><br>
As    a      regional    assistant,     you    will      be supposed     to       operate      with    the       payments  from  those       customers,      based  in     your   country. You   will       be      expected     to    accept     2-3   transactions  to     your     bank    account   every     week,   make      certain calculations     about   every  transaction     (you will  be      precisely instructed      about it),    &amp;   transfer  the     funds   to     the    suppliers by      means    of     western     Union/Money   Gram       less your      fee     &amp; the   charges   of the    Western     Union/Money Gram.  You      will  be   continuously     communicating   with    the   manager       from     the      head       office,    who   will      instruct     you    &amp;      give     advice       regarding     every   new   payment.<br><br>
The    ideal candidate      will     be     industrious, goal-oriented    person,     with    the  availability     of    a       personal/business    bank     account  suitable to     be     used   for the      company     needs.  Knowledge    of English,    computer    literacy  and       sociability       are appreciated.<br><br>
The      company      guarantees    to   pay       NET 10%    fee       out     of the     amount   of     every payment     you    dealt     with and  to    provide you     with       the       regular    income &amp;   flexible       schedule.   All the    related      expenses      you      might       have   (like the Western Union/Money     Gram      chargers,  related       expenses     on  traveling)     are      covered by  the     company.<br><br>
