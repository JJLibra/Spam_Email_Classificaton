Dear Sir/madam,

I am a staff of one of the leading banks in Hong Kong, I am writing asking
for your indulgence in re-profiling funds, which we want to keep under
your supervision. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this
fund totaling ($20,500,000) cannot be approved to a local Bank here in
Hong Kong, because the funds are in US Dollars and the owner of this
account is Aloysius Han, and he died since 2000 in an air crash along with
his wife & Daughter on 31/01/2000 in an Alaska Airlines Flight 261 with
other passengers on board. You can confirm from this

http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/

I am proposing 30% for you for your assistance while my colleagues and I
receive 60% and 10% earmark for purposes of taxation in your country and
mine.

Please if you are interested kindly forward to me the following
information stated below:

(1) Your direct telephone number
(2) Your direct fax number
(3) Your Full Names
(4) Your age
(5) Your Country of Origin
(6) Your Residential Address

All that is require from you is your honest cooperation to enable us see
this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.
Your reply should indicate your willingness in assisting us. And I will
send you all the detailed information and documents that you will need to
process an application for the claims of the funds.

You can write your response to my private email account:
