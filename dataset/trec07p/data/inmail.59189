       <p>Dear Health Conscience Friend,<br>
                           <br>
 If your doctor has ever spoken to you about cholesterol, 
 you will probably relate to this disturbing but true story.</p>
 
 A well educated, well intentioned doctor has a 
 patient who is in good physical shape, but her cholesterol is 
 higher than it should be.  He prescribes a common statin medication such as Lipitor, Zocor or Crestor.</p>
 <p>  
 
 The patient tells the doctor she has heard about certain problems with these drugs.
 He acknowledges that they have common minor side effects and 
 uncommon serious side affects.  But he does not even seem to think this should 
 be an issue. The patient understandably has no desire to submit her body to unneeded potential problems.  The doctor doesn't really listen to anything 
 she says.  His mind was made up before she walked in the door.  </p>
 
 What is most sad about this very real scenario is that there is a completely 
 <a href="http://rickbossetty.com/c/0rjrgash0ujRwKbRpNRR-A.html?0">natural substance that cuts the body's absorption of 
 cholesterol</a> by up to 42%.  
 
 The American Medical 
 Association, American Heart Association 
 and the NIH all recommend its usage.  
 But unless you search for it, you would never know.

 The Pharmaceutical Industry on the other hand spends endless amounts of money 
 influencing doctors, the government and the general public.  It is not disputed that cholesterol medications 
 have saved countless lives.  But it is also not disputed that this <a href="http://rickbossetty.com/c/0rjrgash0ujRwKbRpNRR-A.html?0">natural cholesterol discovery</a> cuts cholesterol absorption 
 with absolutely <a href="http://rickbossetty.com/c/0rjrgash0ujRwKbRpNRR-A.html?0">no side affects</a>.  
 
 <p>That is why we are willing to
 <a href="http://rickbossetty.com/c/0rjrgash0ujRwKbRpNRR-A.html?0">send you $100 if it doesn't work for you</a>.  We know it works.  There are no catches.  We send out $100 gift
 certificates every month for the rare person that is not benefitied by it. </p>
 
 <p>Frankly, it is irresponsible for doctors not to try the <a href="http://rickbossetty.com/c/0rjrgash0ujRwKbRpNRR-A.html?0">natural supplement</a> 
 that has been proven to cut your body's absorption of cholesterol.  It is 
 <a href="http://rickbossetty.com/c/0rjrgash0ujRwKbRpNRR-A.html?0">perfectly safe</a> and would help minimize the use of statins.  </p>
