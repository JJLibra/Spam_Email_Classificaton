Thanks for giving me your time. I am Sir. James Martins .A, a consulting au=
ditor attached with a private Banking Services in London - UK. I am contact=
ing you concerning a customer of our bank who had an investment placed unde=
r the bank's management 3 years ago valued at 14.2 Million United States Do=
llars which he wished to have us turn over on his behalf.
=20
In August 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to =
make an urgent investment requiring cash payments. He directed that I liqui=
date the funds and had it deposited with HANDELSBANKEN, a top Swedish bank =
but due to the complexities of the task he was asking of us, he later instr=
ucted the transfer to be stopped and told me he would use the money upon hi=
s arrival from the States. This was the last communication we had since the=
n. The bank has launched an investigation to know his where about but to no=
 avail. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin this is because in t=
he field of private banking, opening an account means no one will know of i=
ts existence, accounts are rarely held under a name. Depositors use numbers=
 and codes to make the accountsanonymous.
=20
As things stands now, there is 18.5 Million USD as value for his investment=
 and the bank has no single idea of the history or nature of the deposit. T=
hey are simply awaiting for instructions to release the deposit to any part=
y that comes forward. This bank has spent great amount of money trying to t=
rack the man's family and have investigated for months but found no known r=
elative. After going through your profile, I decided to contact and place y=
ou in a position and instruct the bank to release the deposit to you as the=
 closest relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the =
money with you and no more. That is, we share the proceeds 85% for me and 1=
5% for you. All the expenses to ensure a smooth and successful transfer of =
the fund to your account will come from my side. I only need your full co-o=
peration and to be following my instructions strictly.=20
    =20
Get back to me with the following to enable us proceed accordingly:  (1) Yo=
ur correct bank account information for the transfer. (2) Your direct telep=
hone numbers where you can easily be reached to enable me contact you for u=
s to have a heart to heart conversation. (3) I want you to re-assure me tha=
t you will never let me down either now or in future.
=20
Hope to hear from you.
