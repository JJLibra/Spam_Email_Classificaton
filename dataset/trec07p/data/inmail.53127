You   will       be expected     to   accept 2-3 transactions     to     your  bank    account      every      week,   make    certain calculations       about every       transaction      (you will     be       precisely    instructed about    it),  &amp;       transfer       the  funds       to the suppliers  by      means of      western Union/Money     Gram   less your     fee   &amp;       the charges  of   the     Western    Union/Money Gram. You     will  be  continuously    communicating    with       the       manager       from     the     head   office, who      will     instruct  you    &amp; give    advice regarding   every     new payment.<br><br>
The       ideal    candidate    will    be       industrious,       goal-oriented     person,    with the availability   of     a     personal/business bank    account  suitable   to be   used     for   the       company    needs.
