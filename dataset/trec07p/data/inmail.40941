<center><=21--Without enough votes to override Bush's veto, Democrats are laboring to s=
end Bush new legislation by Memorial Day that challenges Bush's Iraq policy but ensures tr=
oops have the resources they need.

The House wants to fund the war in two-month installments, giving members a chance to cut of=
f money for combat if conditions in Iraq do not improve.

That approach is not expected to survive the Senate, where Democrats hold a razor-thin maj=
ority and several of them oppose limiting war funding. Bush also has threatened to veto the=
 approach.
