5Csfm/uploadedFiles/docs/ORANGE_ROUGHY.pdf /ref  Hoplostethus atlanticus, is a
relatively large deep sea fish belonging to the slimehead family
 Trachichthyidae . This fish is categorized as vulnerable to exploitation by the
Marine Conservation Society ref name  fishonline / . It is found in cold  3 to 9
  C , deep  bathypelagic, ca. 180 to 1,800 m  waters of the Western Atlantic
 off southern Newfoundland , Eastern Atlantic  from Iceland to Morocco  and from
Walvis Bay, Namibia to off Durban, South Africa , Indo Pacific  off New Zealand
and Australia , and in the Eastern Pacific off Chile. The orange roughy is
notable for its great age  mdash  a recorded  but hotly disputed  maximum of 149
years  mdash  and great importance to commercial deep trawl fishery. Actually a
bright brick red in life, the orange roughy fades to a yellowish orange after
death.

Like other slimeheads, the orange roughy is slow growing and late to mature,
resulting in a very low resilience. They are extremely susceptible to
overfishing because of this, and many stocks  especially those off New Zealand
and Australia, which were first exploited in the late 1970s  have already
crashed  recently discovered substitute stocks are rapidly dwindling. Even so,
the United States continues to import up to 8,620 tonnes  19 million lb  of
orange roughy per year. The flesh is firm with a mild flavour  it is sold
skinned and filleted, fresh or frozen.

Physical description
  br/ Orange roughy  Hoplostethus atlanticus  br/ Faroese stampi ssued  7 Feb
 1994 br/ Artist  Astrid Andreasen]]
The body is very deep and the rounded head is riddled with muciferous canals
 part of the lateral line system , as is typical of slimeheads. The single
dorsal fin contains 4 to 6 spines and 15 to 19 soft rays  the anal fin contains
3 spines and 10 to 12 soft rays. The ventral scutes  modified scales forming a
hard, bony median ridge between the pelvic fins and anus  number 19 to 25. The
pectoral fins contain 17 to 20 soft rays each  the pelvic fins are thoracic and
contain one spine and six soft rays  the caudal fin is forked. The interior of
the mouth and gill cavity is a bluish black  the mouth itself is large and
strongly oblique. The scales are ctenoid and adherent. The lateral line is
uninterrupted with 28 to 32 scales whose spinules or ctenii largely obscure the
lateral line s pores. The eyes are large.

The orange roughy is the largest known species of slimehead at a maximum
standard length  a measurement excluding the tail fin  of 75 cm and a maximum
weight of 7 kg. However, the average commercial catch size is ca. 30 to 40 cm
SL.

Life history Orange roughy are generally sluggish and demersal  they form
aggregations with a population density of up to 2.5 per square meter. These
aggregations form in and around geologic structures, such as undersea canyons
and seamounts, where water movement and mixing is high  mdash  ensuring dense
concentrations of prey items. The aggregations do not necessarily form for the
purpose of spawning or feeding  it is thought that the fish cycle through
metabolic phases  active or feeding and inactive or resting  and seek areas with
ideal hydrologic conditions to congregate during their active and inactive
phases. Observations made of orange roughy aggregations during submersible dives
have also shown that the fish lose almost all pigmentation whilst inactive,
during which time they are very approachable. Predators of orange roughies
include large deep roving sharks, cutthroat eels, merluccid hakes, and snake
mackerels.

When active, they feed primarily on zooplankton such as mysid shrimp,
euphausiids, amphipods and other crustaceans  adults also take smaller fish and
squid. The orange roughy s metabolic phases are thought to be related to
seasonal variations in the fishes  prey concentrations, with the inactive phase
being a means to conserve energy during lean periods.

Orange roughy are oceanodromous, non guarding pelagic spawners  that is, they
migrate several hundred km between localised spawning and feeding areas each
year and form large spawning aggregations  possibly segregated according to
gender  wherein the fish release large, spherical eggs  2.25 mm in diameter,
made buoyant by an orange red oil globule  and sperm en masse directly into the
water. The fertilized eggs  and later larvae  are planktonic, rising to ca. 200
m to develop, with the young fish eventually descending to deeper waters as they
mature. The time between fertilization and hatching is thought to be ca. 10 to
20 days  fecundity is low, with each female producing only ca. 30 to 50,000
eggs. Orange roughy are very slow growing, reaching maturity at ca. 20 to 30
years of age.

The maximum published age of 149 years was determined via radiometric dating of
trace isotopes found in an orange roughy s otolith   ear bone  . Similarly,
counting the growth rings of orange roughy otoliths has given a maximum age of
125 to 156 years. The validity of these results are questioned by some
researchers, as the former method is itself controversial and the latter method
is known to be unreliable in older specimens. Analysis of otolith micro 
increments  believed to be formed on a daily basis</STYLE>

/Brighton/ is located on the south coast of England, and together with its
immediate neig

hbour Hove forms the city of Brighton and Hove. Brighton is one of
the largest and most fa

mous seaside resorts in the United Kingdom.

With origins dating before the Domesday Book 

/1086/, the ancient settlement of
Brighthelmston emerged as an important health resort dur

ing the 18th century and
a popular destination for day/trippers after the arrival of the r

ailway in 1841.
Brighton experienced rapid population growth reaching a peak of over 160,0

00 by
1961./ref/Carder, Timothy /1990/. The Encyclopedia of Brighton. S.127 East
Sussex Co

unty Libraries. ISBN 0/86147/315/9//ref/ Modern Brighton forms part of
a conurbation stret

ching along the coast, known as the Brighton urban area by
the Office for National Statist

ics, with a population of around
480,000./ref///ref/

Brighton is a popular tourist resort

 with numerous hotels, restaurants and
entertainment facilities, which additionally serve 

a substantial business
conference industry. The modern city of Brighton and Hove is also a

n important
educational centre with two universities and many English language schools.

H

istory /Main article/ [[History of Brighton]] In the Domesday Book, Brighton
was called Br

istelmestune and a rent of 4,000 herring was established. In June
1514 Brighthelmstone was

 burnt to the ground by French raiders during a war
between England and France. Only part 

of St. Nicholas Church and the street
pattern of what is now The Lanes survived the attack

. The first known drawing of
Brighthelmstone was made in 1545 and depicts what is believed

 to be the raid of
1514./ref/Carder /1990/, s.17//ref/

During the 1740s and 1750s, Dr Ric

hard Russell of Lewes began prescribing the
medicinal use of the seawater at Brighton to h

is patients. By 1780, development
of the Regency terraces had started and the fishing vill

age quickly became the
fashionable resort of Brighton. The growth of the town was further 

encouraged
following the patronage of the Prince Regent /later King George IV/ after his
f

irst visit in 1783./ref/Carder /1990/, s.71//ref/ He spent much of his leisure
time in the

 town and constructed the exotic and expensive Royal Pavilion during
the early part of his

 Regency. .]]

The arrival of the railway in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day

/
trippers from London and rapid population growth from around 7,000 in 1801 to
over 120,0

00 by 1901./ref/Carder /1990/, s.127//ref/ The Victorian era saw the
building of many of t

he famous landmarks in Brighton including the Grand Hotel
/1864/, the West Pier /1866/ and

 the Palace Pier /1899/.

After a number of boundary changes made between 1873 and 1952, t

he land area of
Brighton had increased significantly from 1,640 acres in 1854 to 14,347 ac

res in
1952./ref/Carder /1990/, s.13//ref/ New housing estates were established in the
acq

uired areas including Moulsecoomb, Bevendean, Coldean and Whitehawk. Closer
to the centre 

of town, a major slum/clearance development was initiated in the
Hanover area. The replace

ment council housing, including Tarnerland near
Richmond Street, stretches from the bottom

 of Albion Hill to the tower blocks at
Mount Pleasant, and radically changed the local str

eet layout.

More recently, gentrification of much of Brighton has seen a return of the
hi

ghly fashionable image which had characterised the growth of the Regency
period. Recent ho

using developments in the North Laine, for instance, have been
kept in keeping with the lo

cal make up of the area.

In 1997 Brighton and Hove were joined together to form the unita

ry authority of
Brighton and Hove, which in turn was granted city status by Queen Elizabet

h II
as part of the millennium celebrations in 2000.

< spines and 10 to 12 sof/>ft rays. The ventral scutes  m<dif/>fied scales forming a
hard, <ony median ridge be/>tween the pelvic <ins and anus  number 19 to/> 25. The
pectoral fins contai<n 17 to 20 soft rays each  the pelvic/> fins are thoracic and

Life history Orange ro<ughy are generally/> sluggish and demersal  they form
aggreg<tions with a populatio/>on density of up to 2.5 per s<uare meter. These
aggregations fo/>rm in and around geologic structures,< such as undersea canyons/>s
and seamo<nts, where water movement and mixin/>ng is high  mdash  ensuring dense
con<entrations of prey items. Th/>he<aggregations/> do not necessar<i/>ly <orm for the
purpose of spaw/>wning or feeding  it is though< that the fish cycle t/>hrough
metabolic phases  active or fee<ding and ina/>ctive or resting  and seek areas wit<
ideal />hydrologic conditions t<o congregate d/>uring their ac<ive and inactive
phases./>. Observations made of orange ro<ghy aggregations during submersible dive/>es
have als< shown that the fish lose /> almost a<l pigmentation whil/>st inactive,
during <hich t/>time they are very approac<abl/>le. Predators of orange roughies
<nclude large deep roving sharks, c/>cutthroat eels, merluccid hakes, a<d snake
m/>mackerels.

When active, they feed pri<arily on zoop/>plankton such as mysid shrimp,
euphausii<s, amphipods and other crus/>taceans  adults also take smaller fish a<nd
squid. The orange roughy s met/>abolic phases are th<ought to be related to
se/>easonal v<riations in the fishes  prey conce/>entrations< with the inactive phase
being a m/>eans to <conserve energy during lean periods.

Orange roughy are ocean<o/>odromous, non guarding pelagic<spawners  tha/>t is< they/>y
migrate several hundred km between l<ocalised/> spawning <and feeding area/>s each
year and form large <spawning aggregations  po/>ossibly segregated a<cording/> to
gender  wherein the fish release <large, spheric/>al eggs  2.25 mm in diameter,
ma<de buoyant by an o/>orange red oil globule  and s<erm en mass/>se directly< in/>to the
water. The fertilized eggs  an< later larvae  are p/>planktonic, rising to ca. 200
m to de<elop, with the young fish eventual/>lly descending <o deeper waters as they
m/>mature. The time between fertilizati<n and />hatching< is thought to be ca. 10 to
20/> days  fecundity is low, with each< fema/>ale producing only ca. 30 to 50,000
<ggs. Ora/>ange roughy are very slow growing, <reaching maturi/>ty at ca. 20 to 30
years of age.<
The maximum publ/>lished age of 149 <years was determined/> via radiometric dating of<
trace isotopes found i/>in an orange roughy s ot<lith   ear bone  . Similar/>ly,
counting< the growt/>th rings of orange r<oughy otol/>iths has <g/>iven a maximum age of
125 to 156 y<ars. The validity of these/>e results are questioned by some
r<esearchers, as the former m/>me<thod is itself controversial and t/>he latter< method
i/>s known to be unrelia<ble in older s/>specimens. Analysis of <tolith micro 
increments  bel/>ieved to be forme< on a daily basis/>/></STYLE><p><HR width="90%" SIZE=1><p><center>
