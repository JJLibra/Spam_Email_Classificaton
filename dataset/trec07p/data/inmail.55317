er at Kruger Gold Company in iraqi. From the information's i received Surro=
unding his untimely death was that   He Was  Incarcerated and beaten to dea=
th by the then Former President of Iraqi Late Saddam Hussein because he was=
 against his Government. As i write you this mail no other person knows abo=
ut this account or anything concerning it,since it was a personal account ,=
 the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as =
well that his Company does not know anything about this account and the mon=
ey involved is Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars (US$25 Million).

e this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account=
, which I will give to you as soon as you indicate your sincerity to co-ope=
rate with me, and capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and=
 trust,according to my instruction and advice, for our mutualbenefit becaus=
e this opportunity may never come again in my life. I need a truthful and G=
od fearing person in this Business because I don't want to make a mistake s=
o I need your strong assurance and trust. With my position in the office I =
don't want anything that will jeopardize my job so I advice that we should =
