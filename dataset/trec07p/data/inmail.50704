SUN Offers License of "Art of War"

International Demand for "Art of War" Creates
New Branding Opportunity

DALLAS, TX--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 4, 2007 -- SUN
Sports & Entertainment Inc. (Other
OTC:SSPE.PK - News) announced today that the
Company is offering its "Art of War" brand
under an exclusive licensing agreement for
domestic and foreign markets.

Preliminary terms of the License Agreement
included a minimum license fee of $25,000
with a per event investment starting at
$500,000. The License Partner will retain
earnings from the live gate, sponsor revenue
and merchandise sales.

SUN is negotiating with several domestic and
foreign groups that are seeking a license of
the "Art of War." Under the terms of an
exclusive license agreement, SUN will select
pre-qualified partners that will co-produce
local and international events under the "Art
of War" banner. These individuals come from
Sports or Events backgrounds and have
determined a demand for the Mixed Martial
Arts (MMA) Sport in their market and want to
provide this type of entertainment.

SUN CEO CJ Comu stated, "This is a great
opportunity for the right strategic partner
to participate in the growth of MMA and host
the SUN 'Art of War' Undisputed Arena
Fighting Championship. The recent surge in
the sport and the international growth and
phenomena will allow us the opportunity to
grow without having to take all the financial
risks associated with an expansion strategy."
Comu added, "We will look for one key
strategic partner in each foreign country and
have many inquires from Australia, Asia,
China, Canada, Europe and Middle East."

UN will offer a full turnkey program to
include: transportation, set up of its custom
cage, match making and booking of fighters,
television, radio and print advertising as
well as event management and operations.
Licensee will provide event license,
insurance and permits. Under the license
program, the licensee will underwrite the
costs associated with bringing the "Art of
War" production to their market and be
responsible for the marketing of the live event.

The growth and phenomena of MMA has created
new opportunities for Sports Professionals.
