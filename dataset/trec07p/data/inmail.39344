  My Heart Will Go On   is the theme song of the 1997 blockbuster film [[Titanic
 1997 film  Titanic]]. With music by James Horner and lyrics by Will Jennings,
it was recorded by C  line Dion. Originally released in 1997 on Dion s album
[[Let s Talk About Love]], it went to number one all over the world, including
the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. My Heart Will Go On was
released in Australia and Germany on December 8 1997, and in the rest of the
world in January and February of 1998.

In March 2007, the United World Chart ranked  My Heart Will Go On  as the
fourteenth most successful song in music history. Referring to that same list,
 My Heart Will Go On  is also the second most successful song released by a solo
female musician behind Whitney Houston s cover of  I Will Always Love You.   ref [http //www.mediatraffic.de/alltime track 
chart.htm 14th most successful song in history] /ref 

History Horner had originally composed the song as an instrumental motif that is
used in several scenes during Titanic. He then wanted to make a full vocal song
out of it, for use in the end credits of the film. Director James Cameron did
not want such a song, but Horner went ahead anyway and got Jennings to write the
lyrics. Dion was Horner s first choice to sing it, but when she heard the song,
she did not want to record it. It was her manager and husband, Ren   Ang  lil,
who convinced her to record a demo version, which was something she hadn t done
for many years. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before
presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared
his approval, although worried that he might be criticised for  going commercial
at the end of the movie. 

The song heard on the radio and included on Dion s album was recorded in one
take, without instrumental accompaniment. Horner, Dion, and later Sony Music
decided to use this first recording because  Dion s voice was perfect.  Two
oddities in this song occur when Dion sings  my heart will go on d  and on  and
 and I know that ch  the heart does go on. 

The music video was directed by Bille Woodruff and released at the end of 1997.
It was included later on the [[All the Way... A Decade of Song and Video]] DVD.

In addition to Dion s Let s Talk About Love and the [[Titanic
 soundtrack  Titanic]] soundtrack,  My Heart Will Go On  appears on several
other albums, including three of Dion s later albums, [[Au C  ur Du Stade]],
[[All the Way... A Decade of Song]], and [[A New Day... Live in Las Vegas]].

At the height of the song s popularity, some radio stations in the U.S. and the
UK played an edited version of the song, that had dramatic moments of dialog
from the Jack and Rose lead characters in the film inserted in between Dion s
vocal lines. It was included later on [[Back to Titanic]].

In France,  My Heart Will Go On  was released as a double A side single with
 The Reason. 

Chart success  My Heart Will Go On  is considered to be one of C  line Dion s
biggest hits and is one of the best selling singles in history. The song reached
number 1 all over the world and and on the United World Chart. Although in the
U.S. it stayed at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 2 weeks, it spent 10
weeks at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay. It was also number 1 for two
weeks on the Hot 100 Singles Sales. Only a limited number of copies were
released   687,000   which were sold out in a few weeks. The single was
eventually certified gold in the US.

In Germany,  My Heart Will Go On  sold over 2 million copies and was certified
4x platinum. It also sold over a million copies in the United Kingdom
 1,312,551  and France  1,197,000  and became 2x platinum and diamond single
respectively. Other certifications include  3x platinum in Belgium  150,000 , 2x
platinum in Australia  140,000 , Netherlands  150,000 , Norway  40,000 ,
Switzerland  100,000 , platinum in Greece  40,000  and gold in Austria  25,000 .
 My Heart Will Go On  was released twice in Japan. Regular edition from January
1998 sold 205,300 and was certified 2x platinum  200,000 .</STYLE>

About two dozen / see section below //

/Birds/ /class /Aves// are bipedal, warm/blooded,

 egg/laying vertebrate animals.
Birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs during the Jurassic,

 and the earliest
known bird is the Late Jurassic [[Archaeopteryx]]. Ranging in size from 

tiny
hummingbirds to the huge Ostrich and Emu, there are between 9,000/10,000 known
living

 bird species in the world, making them the most diverse class of
terrestrial vertebrates.



Modern birds are characterised by feathers, a beak with no teeth, the laying of
hard/she

lled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four/chambered heart, and a light
but strong skeleton.

 Most birds have forelimbs modified as wings and can fly,
though the ratites and several o

thers, particularly endemic island species, have
also lost the ability to fly.

Many speci

es of bird undertake long distance annual migrations, and many more
perform shorter more i

rregular movements. Birds are social and communicate using
visual signals and through call

s and bird song, and participate in social
behaviours including cooperative hunting and br

eeding, flocking. Birds are
primarily socially monogamous, with engagement in extra/pair c

opulations being
common in some species/ other species have polygamous or polyandrous bree

ding
systems. Eggs are usually laid in a nest and incubated and most birds have an
extende

d period of parental care after hatching.

Humans make use of birds in a number of ways/ m

any are important sources of
food, acquired either through hunting or farming, often comme

rcially. Some
species, particularly songbirds and parrots, are popular as pets. Birds figu

re
prominently in all aspects of human culture from religion to poetry and popular
music. 

About 120///130 species have become extinct as a result of human activity
since 1600, and 

hundreds more prior to this. Currently, numerous species of
birds are threatened with exti

nction by human activities and efforts are
underway to protect them.

Evolution and taxono

my



The first classification of bird was developed by Francis Willughby and John Ray
in 

their 1676 volume, Ornithologiae./ref/Del Hoyo, Josep, et al. Handbook of
Birds of the Wor

ld Vol 1 1992. Barcelona/ Lynx Edicions, ISBN 84/87334/10/
5//ref/ That work, slightly mod

ified, was the basis for today/s classification
system originally devised by Carolus Linna

eus in 1758./ref/ //ref/

Birds are categorised as the biological class Aves in Linnean ta

xonomy.
Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the dinosaur clade Theropoda. According to
th

e current consensus, Aves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia, together
are the sole 

living members of the reptile clade Archosauria. Phylogenetically,
Aves is commonly define

d as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor
of modern birds /a specific modern

 bird species like [[House Sparrow/Passer
domesticus]] for the purposes of phylogenetic ta

xonomy/, and
[[Archaeopteryx/Archaeopteryx lithographica]]./ref///ref/ Archaeopteryx, from


the Kimmeridgian stage of the Late Jurassic /some 155/150 million years ago/, is
the earl

iest known bird under this definition. Others have defined Aves to
include only the modern

 bird groups, excluding most groups known only from
fossils,/ref///ref/ in part to avoid t

he uncertainties about the placement of
Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally

 thought of as theropod dinosaurs.////
See WP/RS [http///www.phylonames.org/forum/viewtopi

c.php?t/7]///////Mayr et al
2005 /A well/preserved Archaeopteryx specimen with theropod fe

atures/ + comment
+ Mayr/s comment on the comment///

Modern birds are divided into two su

perorders, the Paleognathae /mostly
flightless birds like ostriches/, and the wildly diver

se Neognathae, containing
all other birds. Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint, the numbe

r of species
cited varies anywhere from 8,800 to 10,200 known living bird species in the
w

orld.

Use of the term /bird/ This article uses /bird/ to denote members of the Aves,
but 

primarily deals with the living birds which are all Neornithes and thus
unquestionably Ave

s. In popular science, the term /bird/ is often used in an
informal sense, denoting any th

eropod with feathers and wings. Thus, animals
such as [[Microraptor]] and [[Rahonavis]] ar

e sometimes called /birds/ in news
articles, although most scientists would not consider t

hem to belong to Aves
based on current evidence.

Dinosaurs and the origin of birds

//, a

 Cretaceous bird from China]]

There is significant evidence that birds evolved from thero

pod dinosaurs,
specifically, that birds are members of Maniraptora, a group of theropods w

hich
includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others./ref/Hou L,Martin M, Zhou Z

  My Heart Will Go On  />  is the theme song of the 1997< blockbuster film [[Titanic
 1997 />fi<lm  Titanic]]. With music by /> James Ho<ner and lyrics by/> Will Jennings,
i< was recorded by C  />lin<e Dion. Originally released in 1997/> on Dion s album
[<Let s Talk Ab/>out Love]], it< went to number one a/>ll over the world, including
the Unite< States, United Kingdom and Australia./>. My Heart< Will Go On was
released in Au/>stralia and Germa<ny on December 8 1997, and/> in the rest <f the
world in January and Februar/>ry of 1998.<
In /> March 2007, the United World<Chart ranked  My Heart Will Go On  as th/>he
fourteenth most successful so<g in music history. Referring to th/>hat same list,
 My Heart Will Go O<  is also the second most succes/>sful song released by< a sol/>lo
fema<e musician behind Whitney Houston s cov/>er of  I Will Always Love You.   ref [<http ///>www.mediatraffic.de/alltime track 
cha<rt.htm 14th most succ/>essful song in history] /ref 

History H<orner had originally comp/>osed the song as an instrumental mot<f that is
used in sever/>al scenes during Titanic.< He th/>en wanted to mak< a full vocal song
out o/>of it, for use in the end<credits of the film./>. Director James Came<ron did
not want such a song, but Horn/>er went ahead anyway and <ot Jennings to /> write the
lyr<cs. Dion was Horn/>ner s first cho<ce to sing it,/> but whe<n she heard/>d the song,
she<did not /> want to rec<ord it. It was her manager />and husband, Ren   Ang<  lil,
who convinced h/>her to record a demo version, wh<ch was something sh/>he hadn t done
for many years. H<orner waited/> until< Cameron was in an appropriate/> mood befo<re
presenting hi/>m with the song. After p<laying it several t/>imes, Cameron dec<lared
his approval, although worried /> that he might be criticised for  going <ommercial
/>
at the end of the movie. 

The< song heard on the radio />and in<luded on Dion s album/>m was recorded in one
tak<, without instrumental accompanime/>ent. H<orner, Dion, and later Sony Mus/>ic
decided to use this first r<cording because  Dion s /> voice was perfect.  Two
oddities in t<i/>is song occur when Dion sing<  my heart w/>will go on d  and on  an<
 and I know that/>t ch  the heart does go on. 

The<music video was directed/> by Bille Woodruff and r<leased at the end of 1997.
It was includ/>ed later on the [[All th<e Way... A Decade of Song and Video]] D/>DVD<

In addition to Dion s Let s Talk Abo/>out Love and the [[Titanic
 soundtr<ack/>  Titanic]] soundtrack,  My He<rt Will Go /> On  appears on several
other albu<s, including three of />Dion s l<ater albums, [[Au C  ur Du Sta/>de]],
[[All the Way... A Decade of< Song/>g]], and [[A New<Day.../>. Live in Las Vegas]].

At<the height of the/> s<o/>ong s <opularity, s/>some radio stations<in the U.S. and />the
UK p<ayed an edited v/>ersion of the song, that had dramatic mo<ments of dialog
from/> the Jack and Rose lead <characters in the film ins/>erted in between Dion s
vocal lin<es. It was included lat/>er on [[Back to Titanic]].

In Franc<e,  M/>y Hear<t Will Go O/>n  was r<leased as a do/>ouble A side single with
 The Reason. <
Chart success  M/>My Heart< Will Go On  is considered t/>to be on< of C  line Dion s
biggest hits an/>d is one of<the best selling singles in h/>istory. The song reached
number 1 a<l over the world and and on the/>e Unite< Wor/>rld Chart. Although in the
U.S. it s<ayed at number 1 on the Billb/>board Hot 100 for 2 weeks, it spent <0
weeks at number 1 on the Billboar/>rd Hot 100 Airplay. It was also number 1< for/> two
weeks on the Hot 100 Singles Sale<s. Only a limited numbe/>er of copies were
release<   687,000   w/>hich were s<old out in a f/>few weeks. The single was
eventually cer<ified gold in the US.

In Germany,  My/>y Heart Will Go On  sold over 2 <million/> copies and< was certified
4x platinum/>.< It also sold over a million copies i/>n <the United Kingdom
 1,3/>12,551  and<France  1,197,000  an/>nd became 2x platinum and diamond singl<
