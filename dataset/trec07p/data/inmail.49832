 Octopoida br  small Leach, 1817 /small     The  octopus   Greek
  Unicode                    ,  eight legs   is a cephalopod of the order
 Octopoda  that inhabits many diverse regions of the ocean, especially coral
reefs. The term may also refer to only those creatures in the genus [[Octopus
 genus  Octopus]]. In the larger sense, there are 289 different octopus species,
which is over one third of the total number of known cephalopod species.

Physiology Octopuses are characterized by their eight arms  not tentacles ,
usually bearing suction cups. These arms are a type of muscular hydrostat.
Unlike most other cephalopods, the majority of octopuses  mdash  those in the
suborder most commonly known, Incirrina  mdash  have almost entirely soft bodies
with no internal skeleton. They have neither a protective outer shell like the
nautilus, nor any vestige of an internal shell or bones, like cuttlefish or
squids. A beak, similar in shape to a parrot s beak, is the only hard part of
their body. This enables them to squeeze through very narrow slits between
underwater rocks, which is very helpful when they are fleeing from morays or
other predatory fish. The octopuses in the less familiar Cirrina suborder have
two fins and an internal shell, generally lessening their ability to squeeze
into small spaces.

Octopuses have a relatively short life span, and some species live for as little
as six months. Larger species, such as the North Pacific Giant Octopus, may live
for up to five years under suitable circumstances. However, reproduction is a
cause of death  males can only live for a few months after mating, and females
die shortly after their eggs hatch, for they neglect to eat during the  roughly 
one month period spent taking care of their unhatched eggs.

Octopuses have three hearts. Two pump blood through each of the two gills, while
the third pumps blood through the body. Octopus blood contains the copper rich
protein hemocyanin for transporting oxygen. Less efficient than the iron rich
hemoglobin of vertebrates, the hemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of
being bound in red blood cells and gives the blood a blue color. Octopuses draw
water into their mantle cavity where it passes through its gills. As mollusks,
octopuses have gills that are finely divided and vascularized outgrowths of
either the outer or the inner body surface.

The /donkey/ or /ass or barney/, Equus asi

nus, is a domesticated animal of the
horse family, Equidae.

Traits .]]

Most wild donkeys

 are between 1 and 1.60 m in length. Domestic donkeys stand
from 0.9 to over 1.40 m tall. 

The Andalucian/Cordobesan breed of southern Spain
can reach up to 1.60 m high. Donkeys are

 adapted to marginal desert lands, and
have many traits that are unique to the species as 

a result. They need less food
than horses. Overfed donkeys can suffer from a disease calle

d laminitis. Unlike
horse fur, donkey fur is not waterproof, and so they must have shelter

 when it
rains. Wild donkeys live separated from each other, unlike tight wild horse
herds

. Donkeys have developed very loud voices, which can be heard for over
three kilometers, t

o keep in contact with other donkeys of their herd over the
wide spaces of the desert. Don

keys have larger ears than horses to hear the
distant calls of fellow donkeys, and to help

 cool the donkey/s blood. Donkeys/
tough digestive system can break down inedible vegetati

on and extract moisture
from food more efficiently. Donkeys can defend themselves with a p

owerful kick
of their hind legs. Donkeys are frequently considered among the most morose
m

ember of the family Equidae, although some posit that the faces of mules and
even hinnies,

 in their darkest moments, rival the donkey/s saturnine visage.
