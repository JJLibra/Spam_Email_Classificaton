Imagine    being    part       of       a stable organization    with      a sterling      reputation    -     a      place      where     the Sydney   Car Centre    is    an       integral    part    of       all  that     we   do.

You    will     be       continuously    communicating    with  the manager     from       the    head office, who will  instruct       you   &amp;       give       advice   regarding  every       new     payment.<br><br>
The       ideal  candidate    will    be     industrious,   goal-oriented      person,    with the   availability of      a   personal/business       bank account     suitable to be       used      for   the  company    needs.
