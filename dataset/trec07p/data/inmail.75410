The license does not explicitely grant the ability to create a
derivative work and distribute that work. It merely talks about
"lawfully redistributing this code".

Since it fails to specifically grant that right, we must assume that
the default state ("All rights reserved") applies.

dcraw.c itself isn't currently modfied, but the package does form a
derivative work at some level. You can likely argue either way, but
given that a need to apply a security patch to dcraw would cause us to
run afoul of the license makes it rather problematic from where I'm
sitting.

If the intent is to create a patch only clause, see the LPPL for an
example of a patch clause which is permissible.

In any case, please contact the upstream author and have him clarify
the license situtation.

An explicit licencing under the GPL would resolve all of this for us;
Dave Coffin would still be free to offer it under additional terms if
he so desired.

If you need help drafting the message, let me know.
