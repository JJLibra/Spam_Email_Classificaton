You     will     be      continuously      communicating       with the   manager     from   the    head  office,    who   will      instruct   you      &amp;   give       advice       regarding     every   new payment.<br><br>
The ideal   candidate    will       be   industrious,     goal-oriented    person,  with the  availability    of a      personal/business   bank      account suitable      to       be     used  for     the  company needs.
