 University of Waikato  is located in Hamilton and Tauranga, New Zealand, and
was established in 1964. It has strengths across a broad range of subject areas,
particularly its degrees in Computer Science and in Management. Its School of
M  ori and Pacific Development is acknowledged as the world centre for study in
this subject area.

In 2002 over 14,000 students were enrolled at the university. More than a
quarter of students were aged over 25, and over half were women. It has the
highest proportion of M  ori students on any campus in New Zealand. The M  ori
character of the campus is an important aspect of its overall identity.

The University of Waikato in Hamilton is spread over 0.67 km    170 acres  of
landscaped park like grounds, and includes extensive sporting and recreational
areas surrounding three ornamental lakes. Many sporting and cultural groups are
active on campus, including various international students  clubs. The
university provides study facilities including modern lecture rooms and
laboratories, a library of over 1,000,000 volumes, and an extensive computer
network with over 800 terminals.



The  University of Waikato at Tauranga   formerly Tauranga University College 
offers 150 papers.

The university consists of seven Schools of Studies  Faculties .
  Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences
  Waikato Management School
  School of Education
  School of Science and Engineering
  School of Computing and Mathematical Science
  School of Law
  School of M  ori and Pacific Development

These schools offer undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate degrees in their
respective subject areas.

Research The university s research involvement is varied, and it is noted for
research in the management disciplines of Accounting, Finance and Human Resource
Management  Computer Science, Mathematics, Science, particularly in the
Biological Sciences including both Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour and
Cellular, Molecular and Whole Organism Biology, and Chemistry, Education and the
Social Sciences.

The University has many research facilities, including
  [http   cber.bio.waikato.ac.nz  Centre for Biodiversity and Ecology Research]
  Stable Isotope Unit
  Management Research Centre
  Technology Management and Innovation Unit
  Centre for Labour and Trade Union Studies
  Carbon Dating Unit
  Honey Research Unit
  Thermophile Research Unit
  Antarctic Research Unit
  International Global Change Institute Research is further reinforced by close
  contact between the University and commercial or governmental research
  facilities located on or adjacent to the campus. Significant among them are
  the Ruakura Research Centre  the largest agricultural and horticultural
  research facility in the Southern Hemisphere , Landcare, National Institute
  for Water and Atmospheric Research  NIWA Ecosystems , and the Institute of
  Professional Legal Studies.

Cementing the University s role as a key New Zealand research institute is
UNILink, the University s own consulting division, dedicated to national and
international sourcing of commercial research contracts. As a result the
University attracts the highest percentage of research income in proportion to
its student population of any university in New Zealand.

Particular strengths The Department of Biological Sciences is clearly thee top
research centre in Biology for all of New Zealand. The department earned first
place rankings in both panels of PBRF  Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour and
Cellular, Molecular and Whole Organism Biology. Within EEB, the department has
long term FRST funding in the areas of  restoration ecology  in both terrestrial
and freshwater systems, reaching from urban to natural ecosystems, and from
molecular ecology to environmental biology.

The School of M  ori and Pacific Development is almost certainly the leading
centre of academic study of things M  ori. Similarly, the law school is a
leading centre for research into the Treaty of Waitangi. Because of the youth of
the university the library s holdings are relatively undeveloped, but there are
significantly holdings of Tainui taonga.

The Computer Science department is particularly strong, with research groups in
networking, machine learning, digital libraries, Formal methods for Software
Engineering and usability.

The university is co located with Ruakura, a center for research in the primary
industries.
