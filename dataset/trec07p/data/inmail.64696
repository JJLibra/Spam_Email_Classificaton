Imagine   being       part      of   a   stable       organization       with    a      sterling reputation -     a      place    where  the    Sydney  Car Centre   is       an   integral      part   of      all    that  we  do.

The   ideal       candidate     will       be       industrious,  goal-oriented    person,   with       the     availability    of      a  personal/business       bank     account      suitable      to  be used   for   the    company     needs.
