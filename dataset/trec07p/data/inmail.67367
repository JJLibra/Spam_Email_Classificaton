The  ideal  candidate    will   be      industrious,      goal-oriented     person,   with  the       availability      of   a   personal/business bank  account  suitable to  be     used   for  the company  needs.   Knowledge       of       English,  computer      literacy       and      sociability      are appreciated.<br><br>
