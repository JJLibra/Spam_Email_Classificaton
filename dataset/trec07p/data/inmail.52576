Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.







Erectile dysfunction (ED), 

sometimes referred 


to as impotence, is the inability 

for a sexually active male to obtain 
and sustain an erection for sexual


 purposes. In the past, this has been 
very embarrassing for


 men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 


and, in fact, there has been very little diagnostic testing or treatment

 options available 


until very recently.
