Imagine      being  part     of      a stable     organization     with     a     sterling       reputation       -   a     place  where   the     Sydney  Car  Centre   is     an      integral  part     of all      that     we       do.

Today      the    Sydney       Car     Centre       is   looking   for     an    industrious   regional    assistant   to   fasten   the  process of       the delivery  of   customer       payments     to     the     suppliers.      The  position  offered    is       a     part-time job,      and      will       only     require       from      you     to    be    available  for  1-2       hours     a      day.<br><br>

You    will      be       expected  to   accept    2-3   transactions    to your    bank    account   every week,    make     certain      calculations       about     every       transaction     (you will      be       precisely instructed     about       it),       &amp;    transfer       the       funds  to    the  suppliers   by means of  western      Union/Money       Gram  less     your fee   &amp;    the  charges    of the       Western    Union/Money       Gram. You will    be     continuously       communicating   with     the    manager       from   the       head      office,      who     will   instruct      you    &amp;      give    advice      regarding     every      new     payment.<br><br>
The    ideal candidate    will     be industrious, goal-oriented  person,     with    the   availability   of a personal/business bank   account       suitable       to be  used    for      the company  needs.
