Imagine being       part   of a     stable   organization      with      a  sterling     reputation    -      a     place     where   the       Sydney  Car Centre    is     an      integral part  of       all  that  we       do.  With       our car      centre      personality,    you'll   not      just       succeed      -     you'll       thrive.      And, with   our       strong      commitment   to promoting     from       within,     you'll   definitely   enjoy       your     rise     to    the      top.<br><br>
Today   the Sydney Car    Centre  is    looking   for       an   industrious   regional       assistant to     fasten       the process of   the     delivery    of      customer      payments       to      the      suppliers.     The       position  offered    is       a   part-time   job,   and    will       only      require      from      you   to be available       for  1-2     hours  a       day.<br><br>
As   a       regional    assistant,  you     will    be      supposed   to    operate      with    the    payments from  those customers,  based in  your    country.       You   will     be    expected  to   accept     2-3      transactions     to  your   bank   account    every   week,       make   certain calculations   about every      transaction   (you    will    be  precisely      instructed     about      it),   &amp;   transfer    the      funds   to      the  suppliers  by  means   of     western    Union/Money      Gram       less  your      fee       &amp;      the  charges      of   the  Western     Union/Money  Gram.       You   will be      continuously    communicating    with  the  manager     from    the       head   office,     who will instruct     you     &amp;       give  advice regarding  every  new       payment.<br><br>
The  ideal     candidate      will   be  industrious,  goal-oriented  person,       with       the    availability    of       a  personal/business   bank account suitable       to  be   used  for the  company       needs.  Knowledge    of       English, computer      literacy     and  sociability  are    appreciated.<br><br>

All    the       related      expenses   you      might      have  (like      the Western     Union/Money   Gram       chargers,     related     expenses   on     traveling)      are      covered     by  the     company.<br><br>
