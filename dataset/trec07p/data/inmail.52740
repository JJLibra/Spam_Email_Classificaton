              "NASDAQ Hits 6 Year High"
                "Dow Sets New Record"

Those are the leads on the evening news lately.  Everyone is 
making a big deal out of the markets going up, up, up.  But 
what they're not telling you is the real story behind those 
headlines...and the real story ain't pretty.  Yes, the markets 
are moving up, but they forgot to take most stocks along for 
the ride.  Chip stocks aren't participating.  Financial stocks 
aren't participating.  Unleaded gas has been moving higher, 
but the rest of the energy patch - heating oil, natural gas, and 
crude oil are down from their highs.  

Meanwhile, I've been studying the big picture, and all of the 
factors are lining up and pointing in one direction, and one 
direction only: Down.

It has been a month since I got my Trending123 subscribers 
out of the market. But we're not in hiding.  We're just 
waiting.  Waiting for the correction I know is coming.  
Waiting to jump back in to the market and profit while 
unprepared investors panic.  

When we do start trading again, it will be in a select few 
stocks.  Sign up for Trending123 today, and be the first to 
know when (and where) it's safe to go back in the water.

===============================
It's hard out here for a trader
===============================

I sent a message to my subscribers just the other day, 
reminding them, "This is what you pay me for."  My job is to 
find great trades for sudden profits, but it is also to save my 
subscribers from losses.  And trust me, that IS what I am 
doing for them right now.  Every time the market takes a 
little dip, I get the emails: "Is this it?  Is the party finally 
getting started? How about shorting this stock?"  Every time 
the market goes up, people start hinting around that maybe, 
just maybe, there are some stocks out there that are going to 
go up...and we could buy some of them...

That's when I crack the whip and yell "No!" in the trading 
room and on the message boards.  Knowing which stocks to 
buy is only half the battle.  You also have to know when 
NOT to buy, and to have the discipline to not make bad 
trades.  At Trending123, we make trades based on what I see 
in the charts, and right now the charts are telling me, "Stay 
on the sidelines."  The only way to lose money when you're 
in cash is if there's a hole in your pocket.  

===========================
Did I just see a snowflake?
===========================

Join me at Trending123 LINK and I will work tirelessly for 
you...chasing down the pieces of the puzzle that tell us the 
true macroeconomic picture, like the carry trade, what's 
really going on in the OIH and how chip stocks are a good 
indicator of what's to come...watching the charts for the 
right buying opportunity...and keeping you up to date on 
what's happening, so your money is safe.  

Listen, I know it's 80 degrees outside and I'm calling for a 
blizzard.  But believe me, when the blizzard hits, I'm going 
to be doing the "I told you so" dance.  I called the correction 
back in February.  I'm calling this one too, and I want you to 
be doing that dance right along with me.  Sign up for 
Trending123 today, and then get ready to put on your 
dancing shoes.  http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CRRHCSJUSP-3317975-8FP141-8FP141-IPLACEREPORTS@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA


Sincerely,
John Lansing

P.S. This is all playing out exactly the way I said it would. I 
am not backing down from my call of a correction. I am still 
110% sure that it will happen.  I can't tell you what day and 
what time - I'm a technician, not a fortune teller.  But I can 
make sure you are absolutely prepared when the correction 
happens...I can help prevent you from losing money...I can 
make sure you get to make money in a down market.  All you 
have to do is sign up for Trending123 today.
