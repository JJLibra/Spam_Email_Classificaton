 Yale University  is a private university in New Haven, Connecticut. Founded in
1701 as the Collegiate School, Yale is the third oldest institution of higher
education in the United States and is a member of the Ivy League. Particularly
well known are its undergraduate school, Yale College, and the Yale Law School,
each of which has produced a number of U.S. presidents and foreign heads of
state. In 1861, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences became the first school
in the United States to award the Ph.D. degree. Also notable is the Yale School
of Drama which has produced many prominent Hollywood and Broadway actors, as
well as the art, music, medical and architecture schools, each of which is often
cited as among the finest in their respective fields.

The university s assets include a $20 billion ref name  endowment   /ref 
endowment  the second largest of any academic institution in the world  and more
than a dozen libraries that hold a total of 12.1 million volumes. Yale has 3,300
faculty members, who teach 5,300 undergraduate students and 6,000 graduate
students. ref About Yale  [http //yale.edu/about/facts.html  Facts. ] Retrieved

Yale s 70 undergraduate majors are primarily focused on a liberal curriculum,
and few of the undergraduate departments are pre professional in nature. About
20  of Yale undergraduates major in the sciences, 35  in the social sciences,
and 45  in the arts and humanities. ref Yale University

Yale uses a residential college housing system modeled after those at Oxford and
Cambridge. Each of 12 residential colleges houses a representative cross section
of the undergraduate student body, and features numerous facilities, seminars,
resident faculty, and support personnel.

Yale s graduate programs include those in the Graduate School of Arts and
Sciences  mdash  covering 53 disciplines in the Humanities, Social Sciences,
Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences and Engineering  mdash  and those in the
Professional Schools of Architecture, Art, Divinity, Drama, Forestry

/Mudle Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat/, marquis /de Condorcet/ /September 17, 1743
///

 March 28, 1794/ was a French philosopher, mathematician, and early political
scientist wh

o devised the concept of a [[Condorcet method]]. Unlike many of his
contemporaries, he adv

ocated a liberal economy, free and equal public education,
constitutionalism, and equal ri

ghts for women and people of all races. His ideas
and writings were said to embody the ide

als of the Age of Enlightenment and
rationalism, and remain influential to this day. He di

ed a mysterious death in
prison after a period of being a fugitive from French Revolutiona

ry authorities.

Early life Condorcet was born in Ribemont, Aisne, and descended from the 

ancient
family of /Caritat/, who took their title from the town of Condorcet in
Dauphin//,

 of which they were long/time residents. Fatherless at a young age, he
was raised by his d

evoutly religious mother. He was educated at the Jesuit
College in Reims and at the [[Coll

//ge de Navarre]] in Paris, where he quickly
showed his intellectual ability, and gained h

is first public distinctions in
mathematics. When he was sixteen, his analytical abilities

 gained the praise of
Jean le Rond d/Alembert and Alexis Clairault/ soon, Condorcet would 

study under
D/Alembert.

>From 1765 to 1774, he focused on science. In 1765, he published h

is first work
on mathematics entitled Essai sur le calcul int//gral, which was very well
r

eceived, launching his career as a respected mathematician. He would go on to
publish many

 more papers, and on February 25, 1769, he was elected to the
[[French Academy of Sciences

/Acad//mie royale des Sciences]] /French Royal
Academy of Sciences/.


In 1772, he publish

ed another paper on integral calculus which was widely hailed
as a groundbreaking paper in

 several domains. Soon after, he met Jacques Turgot,
a French economist, and the two becam

e friends. Turgot was to be an
administrator under King Louis XV in 1772, and later became

 Controller/General
of Finance under Louis XVI /in 1774/.

Condorcet was recognized worldw

ide and worked with such famous scientists as
Leonhard Euler and Benjamin Franklin. He soo

n became an honorary member of many
foreign academies and philosophic societies notably in

 Germany, Imperial Russia,
and the United States.

Early political career In 1774, Condorc

et was appointed Inspector General of the
[[Monnaie de Paris]] by Turgot. From this point 

on, Condorcet shifted his focus
from the purely mathematical to philosophy and political m

atters. In the
following years, he took up the defense of human rights in general, and of


women/s and Blacks/ rights in particular /an abolitionist, he became active in
the Society

 of the Friends of the Blacks in the 1780s/. He supported the ideals
embodied by the newly

 formed United States, and proposed projects of political,
administrative and economic ref

orms intended to transform France.

In 1776, Turgot was dismissed as Controller General. C

onsequently, Condorcet
submitted his resignation as Inspector General of the Monnaie, but 

the request
was refused, and he continued serving in this post until 1791. Condorcet later


wrote Vie de M. Turgot /1786/, a biography which spoke fondly of Turgot and
advocated Tur

got/s economic theories. Condorcet continued to receive prestigious
appointments/ in 1777,

 he was appointed Secretary of the Acad//mie des Sciences,
and, in 1782, secretary of the 

[[Acad//mie Fran//aise]].

Condorcet/s paradox In 1785, Condorcet wrote the Essay on the A

pplication of
Analysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions, one of his most important


works. In this, he explores the /[[Voting paradox/Condorcet/s paradox]]/, which
describes

 the intransitivity of majority preference. The paradox states that it
is possible for a m

ajority to prefer A over B, another majority to prefer B over
C, and another majority to p

refer C over A, all from the same electorate and
same set of ballots.

The paper also outl

ines a generic Condorcet method, designed to simulate pair/
wise elections between all can

didates in an election. He disagreed strongly with
the alternative method of aggregating p

references put forth by Jean/Charles de
Borda /based on summed rankings of alternatives/. 

Condorcet may have been the
first to systematically apply mathematics in the social scienc

es.

Other works In 1786, Condorcet worked on ideas for the differential and integral
calc

ulus, giving a new treatment of infinitesimals / a work which was never
printed. In 1789, 

he published Vie de Voltaire /1789/, which agreed with
Voltaire in his opposition to the C

hurch. In 1798, Thomas Malthus wrote an
[[Essay on the Principle of Population]] partly in
