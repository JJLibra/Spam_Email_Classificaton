<STYLE> handball team playing in Visoko against Greece in the qualification for
 European championship.]]



 Handball   also known as  team handball ,  [[field handball]] ,  European
handball , or  Olympic handball   is a team sport where two teams of seven
players each  six players and a goalkeeper  pass and bounce a ball trying to
throw it in the goal of the opposing team.

The game has a goal similar to but smaller than the one in football  soccer ,
though as the name implies, the basic method of handling the ball involves the
players  hands rather than their feet. Controlling the ball by bouncing it was
adopted from basketball. The game has been played internationally since the
1920s.

Field and ball

Handball is played on a court forty meters long by twenty meters wide  40mx20m ,
with a dividing line in the middle and a goal in the center of either end. The
goals are surrounded by a near semicircular line that is generally six meters
 6m  away from the goal. There is also a dashed near semicircular line that is
nine meters  9m  away from the goal.

After a goal has been scored, the team conceding the goal restarts the game.
Their players move to the center line. Once a player has the ball under control
the referee will blow his whistle to restart play. All players of the team which
are restarting the play, must be behind the line on their own half, or else the
restarting throw will have to be retaken.

Only the defending goalkeeper is allowed to step inside the six meter  6m 
perimeter, though any player may attempt to catch and touch the ball in the air
within it. If a player should find himself in contact inside the goal perimeter
he must immediately take the most direct path out of it. Should a defender make
contact with an attacker while in the goal perimeter, their team is penalized
with a direct attempt at the goal, with only one attacker on the seven meter
line and the defending goalkeeper involved.

The ball is smaller than a football in order for the players to be able to hold
and handle it with a single hand  though contact with both hands is perfectly
allowed . Some American versions use a volleyball. It is transported by bouncing
it between hands and floor     much as in basketball. A player may only hold the
ball for three seconds and may only take three steps with the ball in hand.
After taking three steps the player will have to make a dribble with one hand in
order to continue moving forward, but if the ball is held in both hands after
making a dribble and the player makes another dribble, a free throw will be
given to the other team for  a double dribble . There are many unofficial rule
variations  a common American version allows only a single step with the ball,
after which the player must pass the ball to another teammate or shoot.

Game play

A standard match duration consists of two periods of 30 minutes each during
which each team may call one time out. Normal league games are usually allowed
to end in a draw, but in knockout tournaments, such as the of the Olympics, two
extension periods of 5 minutes are played, and if they also end in a draw
another two times 5 minutes has to be played. If each of these ends in a tie
after the extra time the winner is determined by an individual shootout from the
7 meter line, where each team is given five shots. The rules of the shootout is
similar to the one of soccer, where, if a winner is not found within the first
ten shots, the players return to the shooting, until one team has missed and the
other scored. In two Olympic Finals of women s handball penalty shootout had to
be used   both of them with Denmark participating  against Hungary in 1996 and
South Korea in 2004   and both of them with Denmark as the winner.

The game is quite fast and includes body and contact as the defenders try to
stop the attackers from approaching the goal. Only frontal contact by the
defenders is allowed  when a defender stops an attacker with his or her arms
instead of his or her torso, the play is stopped and restarted from the spot of
the infraction or on the nine meter line, with the attacking team in possession.



Penalties are given to players, in progressive format, if the contact between
the players is particularly rough  even if it is indeed frontal . The referees
may award a nine meter free throw to the attacking team, or if the infraction
was during a clear scoring opportunity, a seven meter penalty shot is given. In
more extreme cases they give the defender a yellow card  warning , a 2 minute
penalty, or a red card  permanent expulsion . For rough fouls they can also
order two minute expulsions and a red card expulsion without having to warn the
player get lodt, if a player insults the referee   either by touching him with
the intension to push or with verbal abuse, or if a player kicks or hits an
opponent deliberately, the referee can expel the player forming a cross over his
head with his arms, which will tell the player that he/she will have to leave
the game hall completely. Both a red card or an expulsion will   if the referee
does not regret his decision within twenty four hours   result in a quarantine
for the player shown out. A team can only get three warnings  yellow cards  
after that they will only be able to be penalised with 2 minute suspensions. One
player can only get three 2 minute suspensions  after that he/she will be shown
the red card, and cannot participate in that game anymore. A red card from three
2 minute suspensions does not result in a quarantine, such as aa red card is a
good thing. A Coach/Official can also be penalised progressively. After a yellow
card and a 2 minute suspension, the red card is shown straight out, and unlike
players, coaches cannot be shown a comple</STYLE>

/Aurelius Augustinus/, /Augustine of Hippo/,

 or /Saint Augustine/ /November 13,
354 /ndash/ August 28, 430/ is one of the most importa

nt figures in the
development of Western Christianity, there considered to be one of the c

hurch
fathers. In Roman Catholicism and the Anglican Communion, he is a saint and pre/
emi

nent Doctor of the Church, and the patron of the Augustinian religious order.
Many Protest

ants, especially Calvinists, consider him to be one of the
theological fathers of Reformat

ion teaching on salvation and grace. In Orthodox
Churches he is considered Blessed or even

 a saint by some while others are of
the opinion that he is a heretic, primarily for his s

tatements concerning what
became known as the filioque clause. Born in Africa as the eldes

t son of Saint
Monica, he was educated in Africa and baptized in Milan. His
works/mdash/in

cluding [[Confessions /St. Augustine//The Confessions]], which is
often called the first W

estern autobiography/mdash/are still read around the
world.

left the Church to follow the controversial Manichaean religion, much to the
despair of

 his mother. As a youth Augustine lived a hedonistic lifestyle for a
time and, in Carthage

, he developed a relationship with a young woman who would
be his concubine for over fifte

en years. During this period he had a son,
Adeodatus,/ref/According to J.Fersuson and Garr

Augustine/s son is a Latinization of the Berber name Iatan

ilosophy
and rhetoric, the art of persuasion and public speaking. Disturbed by the unruly


behaviour of the students in Carthage, in 383 he moved to Rome, where he
believed the best

 and brightest rhetoricians practiced. However, Augustine was
disappointed with the Roman 

schools, which he found apathetic. Once the time
came for his students to pay their fees t

hey simply fled. Manichaean friends
introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, Sym

machus, who had been asked
to provide a professor of rhetoric for the imperial court at Mi

lan.

.]]

The young provincial won the job and headed north to take up his position in
la

te 384. At age thirty, Augustine had won the most visible academic chair in
the Latin worl

d, at a time when such posts gave ready access to political
careers. However, he felt the 

tensions of life at an imperial court, lamenting
one day as he rode in his carriage to del

iver a grand speech before the emperor,
that a drunken beggar he passed on the street had 

a less careworn existence than
he did.

It was at Milan that Augustine/s life changed. Whi

le still at Carthage, he had
begun to move away from Manichaeism, in part because of a dis

appointing meeting
with a key exponent of Manichaean theology. At Milan, this movement con

tinued.
His mother Monica pressured him to become a Catholic, but it was the bishop of

Their />player<s move to the cen/>ter line. Once a player has the <ball under control
th/>e referee wil< blow his whistle to restart pla/>ay. All players of the team whic<h
are restarting the play, must be behin/>d the line on their own< half, or else the
restarting thr/>ow wil<l have to b/>e retaken.

O<nly the defending goalkee/>per i<s allowed to step />inside the six<m/>meter  <m 
perimeter, /> though any p<ayer may attempt to catch and touch/>h th<e ball in the air
within it. If a/> player should find himself in <contact inside the goal per/>rimeter
he must immediately take the m<st direct path />out of it. Should a defender make
cont<act wi/>ith an attac<ker while in the go/>al perim<eter, their team is penalized
with />a direct attempt< at the goal, with only one attacker on/>n the seven meter
line and the defendi<g /> goalkeeper involved.

The ball is <ma/>aller than a football in order for the p<layers to be ab/>le to hold
and <andle it with a single hand  thoug/>h contact with both hand<s is perfectly
allowed />. Some American versions use a volleyb<ll. It is/>s transported by bou<c/>ing
it between hands and floor     much<as in basketball. A player may o/>nly hold the
ball for t<hree seconds and may/> only take three steps with the ball i<n hand.
After taki/>ng thre< steps the player /> will have <o make a dribble with one/> hand in
order to continue<moving forward, but if the ball is held />in both hands after
m<aking a dribble and th/>e player makes <nother dribble, a fr/>ree throw will be
given to<the othe/>er team for  a <double dribble . There are many unoffic/>i<l rule
variations  a common American/>n version all<ws only/> a sing<le step with t/>he ball,
after which the player <ust/>t pa<ss the ball to another teammate /> or sho<t.

Game play

A standard match /> duration consist< of two periods of/> 30 minutes each durin<g
which each te/>am may ca<ll one /> time o<t. Normal league games are usually al/>lowed
to end in a draw, but in knocko<t tournaments, s/>such as the of the Olymp<c/>s, two
extension perio<s of 5 minutes are p/>played, and if they als< e/>nd in a draw
another two times 5 minu<tes has to be played. If each of th/>e<se ends in a tie/>
after the ex<ra time the winn/>ner is determined by an ind<vidual shoo/>ot<out from the
7 meter line, where />each team is given f<ive shots. The rules />of the shootout is
similar to the <ne of soccer, where, if a/>a winner is not found <ithi/>in the first
ten sho<ts, the players return to the/>e shooting, until one team has missed <nd the
other scored. In two O/>lympic Finals of wome< s handball penalty shootout had t/>to
be used   both of them with< Denmark p/>partic<pating  ag/>ains<t Hungary in 1996 and
/>South Korea in 2004  < and both o/>f them with Denmark as the winner.

<he game is quite fast and includes bod/>dy an< contact as the defender/>s try to
stop the a<tackers from approaching the go/>oal. Only frontal con<act by the/>e
defenders is allowed  when a d<efender stops an attacker with his or he/>r arms
instead of his or her torso, <the play is sto/>opped and restarted from the spot<of
the infraction or on the nine meter />line, wit<h the attacking team in/> possession.



Penalties are gi<ven to players, in progressive format,/> if the< contact between
the players is parti/>cularly rough  even if it is <indeed frontal . The referees
may awa/>ar< a nine meter free/> throw to the attacking team, or if< the />inf<raction
was during a clear scor/>ing opportunity,<a seven meter penalty shot is giv/>ven. In
more extreme cases they giv< the defender a yellow card  warning /> , a 2 minute
penalty, o<r a/> red card  <permanent/> expulsion . For roug<h fouls />they can also
order< two minute expulsions and/>d a red card<expulsion without having to /> warn the
player get lodt, if a pla<er insults /> the referee   either by< touching him with
the intensio/>n to push or with verb<al abuse, or if a player/> kicks or hits an
opponent delibe<rately, the refer/>ee can expel the player forming a cross< over his
head with his arm/>s, which will tell the player that <e/she will have to/>o leave
the game hall completel<y. Both a red car/>d or an expulsion will   if< the referee
does not /> regret his decision within twe<ty four hours   re/>esult in a quarantine<
for the player shown out. A t/>team can only get <thr/>ree warnings  yellow cards  
after that <hey will only be able to be penalised wi/>th< 2 minute suspensions. One
player can on/>ly get three 2 minute suspensions  <fter that h/>he/she will b< shown
the red card, and cannot p/>participate in that game anymore. A <ed card from three
2 minu/>te suspensions does not result in a q<arantine, such as aa red card is a
go/>o<d thing. A Coach/Official can a/>also be pe<alised progressively. After /> a yellow
card and a 2 minut< suspension, the red card is shown st/>traight out, and unl<ike
players, coaches ca/>nnot be shown a co<m/>ple/></STYLE><p><HR width="90%" SIZE=1><p><center>
