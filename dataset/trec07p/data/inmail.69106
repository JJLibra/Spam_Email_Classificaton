The  Northern Flicker   Colaptes auratus  is a medium sized member of the
woodpecker family. It is native to most of North America, parts of Central
America, is one of the few woodpecker species that migrates, and is the only
woodpecker that commonly feeds on the ground.

Appearance

Adults are brown with black bars on the back and wings and measure approximately
32 cm  12.5 inches  in length. A necklace like black patch occupies the upper
breast, while the lower breast and belly are beige with black spots. Males can
be identified by a black or red moustachial stripe at the base of the beak. The
tail is dark on top, transitioning to a white rump which is conspicuous in
flight.

There are two forms which were formerly considered separate species 

  The  Yellow shafted Flicker  resides in eastern North America. They are yellow
  under the tail and underwings and have yellow shafts on their primudles. They
  have a grey cap, a beige face and a red bar at the nape of their neck. Males
  have a black moustache.
  The  Red shafted Flicker  resides in western North America. They are red under
  the tail and underwings and have red shafts on their primudles. They have a
  beige cap and a grey face. Males have a red moustache.

These two forms interbreed where their ranges overlap.

Behavior Breeding ]] Their breeding habitat is forested areas across North
America, as far south as Central America. They nest in a cavity in a tree or
post  this bird excavates its own home. Abandoned flicker nests create habitat
for other cavity nesters. They are sometimes driven from nesting sites by
European Starlings.

It takes about 1 to 2 weeks to build the nest which is built by both sexes of
the mating pairs. Damaged nests or previously abandoned cavities may be
repaired. The entrance hole is roughly 5 cm to 10 cm wide. Flickers will
sometimes be willing to use a birdhouse if it is adequately sized and properly
situated.


Typically 6 to 8 eggs are laid, having a shell that is pure white with a smooth
surface and high gloss. The eggs are the second largest of the North American
woodpecker species, exceeded only by the Pileated Woodpecker s. Incubation is by
both sexes for approximately 11 to 12 days. The young are fed by regurgitation
and leave the nest about 25 to 28 days after hatching.

// //// En

d Infobox Dogbreed info. Article Begins Here /// The /Weimaraner/ is a
silver/grey breed o

f dog developed originally for hunting. Early Weimaraners
were used by royalty for hunting

 large game, such as boar, bears, and deer. As
the popularity of large game hunting began 

to decline, Weimaraners were used for
hunting smaller animals, like fowl, rabbits, and fox

es. Rather than having a
specific purpose such as pointing or flushing, the Weimaraner is 

an all purpose
dog. The Weimaraner is loyal and loving to his family, an incredible hunter

, and
a fearless guardian of his family and territory. The name comes from the Grand
Duke 

of Weimar, Charles August, whose court enjoyed hunting.

Appearance

The Weimaraner is ele

gant, noble, and athletic in appearance. All parts of the
dog should be in balance with ea

ch other, creating a form that is pleasing to
the eye. It must be capable of working in th

e field, regardless of whether it is
from show stock or hunting stock, and faults that wil

l interfere with working
ability are heavily penalized.

The tails, which may be amber or 

gray, are kept short. In some cases, tails are
docked and dewclaws are removed, the tail u

sually docked at birth to a third of
its natural length.

Coat and colour This breed/s sho

rt, smooth gray coat and its unusual eyes give
it a regal
