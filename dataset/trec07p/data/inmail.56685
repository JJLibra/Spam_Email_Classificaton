Hey Theorize, It's me again...

Tom Told me about how he turned dirt into gold. It seemed overly-upside down when he was first telling me about it. But I listened because I respect Tom - a lot!!!

So I started and right away I quickly saw the green come in. I am now going to retire in 5-7 years using nothing more than what I am doing now. Simply Amazing.

Now it's your turn.

Dial to hear how 8 8 8 - 4 7 O - 3 6 5 O




PS - My wife and I are going to Italy for a month when we retire...want to join us? Then let's make plans now.
