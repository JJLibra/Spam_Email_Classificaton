      Northeastern University , occasionally abbreviated as  NU  or  NEU , is a
private research university in Boston, Massachusetts. Northeastern s campus is
located among Boston s Fenway, Roxbury, and Back Bay neighborhoods, partly
adjacent to Huntington Avenue.

Northeastern is perhaps best known for its distinctive  co op  program, which
encourages students to alternate semesters of study with periods of paid work
with co operative partners in business and industry. Employers from around the
world participate in the program, providing an avenue for internships and post 
graduation employment. Employers include top ranked international law firms,
banks and corporations, including many of the Fortune 500 companies. The
undergraduate business school is ranked number 26 in the country by Business
Week.

History

Northeastern was established in 1898 as the  Evening Institute for Younger Men 
at the Huntington Avenue YMCA. The Institute catered to needs of the rapidly
growing immigrant population in Boston. Within a few years of its formation, it
offered classes in law, engineering, and finance. In 1909 the school began
offering day classes and it moved to a new location on Huntington Avenue in
1913. The school was officially organized as a college in 1916, and in 1922 it
was renamed  Northeastern University of the Boston Young Men s Christian
Association.  The University continues to rent space for undergraduate housing
in the adjacent Huntington Avenue YMCA. In a period of rapid campus expansion,
the University purchased the Huntington Avenue Grounds  former Boston Red Sox
ballpark  in 1929, but was unable to build on the land due to financial
constraints during The Great Depression.

In 1935, the College of Liberal Arts was added to Northeastern, and the
University s name was simplified to  Northeastern University.  In 1937 The
Northeastern University Corporation was established, creating a board of
trustees made up of 31 members of the NU Corporation and 8 members of the YMCA.
In 1948 Northeastern separated itself completely from the YMCA.

Following World War II, Northeastern began admitting women, and in the boom of
post war college bound students, Northeastern created a College of Education
 1953 , University College  now called the School of Professional   Continuing
Studies   1960 , College of Pharmacy, and College of Nursing  1964 ,
subsequently combined into the Bouv   College of Health Sciences, College of
Criminal Justice  1967  and College of Computer Science  1982 , which has since
been renamed the College of Computer and Information Science.

Since its inception, the University had been a commuter school with many part 
time and evening students, and by the early 1980s had grown to a staggering
60,000 enrollees. In the 1980s, the University decided to drastically reduce the
number of enrolled students in an effort to better fit the mold of the more
prestigious schools around it.

Since 1996, President Richard Freeland has ushered in an extraordinary stage of
institutional change  average SAT scores increased more than 200 points,
retention rates rose dramatically, and applications have doubled. President
Freeland oversaw Northeastern   s largest expansion ever, opening $455 million
in new facilities. The institution has also become substantially more selective,
leading to a more qualified, but less diverse, student body.

During the transition, students endured annual tuition hikes, a re organization
of the co operative education system, and the introduction of a new academic
calendars introduced at the insistence of the faculty. The new calendar features
two traditional semesters and two summer  minimesters , and replaced the popular
quarter system.

Throughout the transformation, President Freeland s oft repeated goal was to
crack the Top 100 of the U.S. News rankings. With this goal accomplished as they
reached number  98  , and with the transformation from commuting school to
national university complete, he stepped down from the presidency on August 15,
2006. His successor is Dr. Joseph Aoun, formerly a dean at
USC.[http //www.president.neu.edu/announcement1.html]

The Campus

Northeastern s campus spans three of Boston s neighborhoods  Back Bay, Fenway,
and Roxbury. The campus is something of an urban oddity  despite its location in
central Boston, Northeastern is home to a remarkable amount of green open space.

Historically, Northeastern had ranked among the ugliest campuses in the United
States. Twice called a    Concrete Jungle    by the APA  American Planning
Association  in the late 1970   s and again in the mid 1980   s. The road to
Northeastern was paved in blacktop and concrete.

A site master planning competition awarded a multi million dollar contract to
revive and rejuvenate the campus and the process was started in 1988 with the
creation of the new Northeastern Quad and Mt Rider. A small oval of land
centrally located at the campus main entrance that was refurbished by the
donations of the graduating class of 1989.

History

Northeastern/> was established i<n 18/>898 as the  Evening Instit<te fo/>or Younger Men 
at the <untington Av/>venue YMCA. The Institute catered t<o needs of/> the rapidly
growing <mmigrant population in Bost/>on. Within a few years of its format<ion, it
offered classes in law, enginee/>ering, and finance. In 1909 the scho<ol began
offering d/>ay classes and it moved to a new locati<on on Huntington Avenue in
191/>13. The school was offi<cially organi/>ized as a college i< 1916, and in 1922 it
was renamed/>d  Nor<heastern University of the Boston Young/> Men s Ch<ristian
Association.  The Universi/>ty continues to re<nt space for undergradu/>uate housing
in the adjacent Huntingto<n Avenue YMCA./>. In a <eriod of/>f rapid campus expansion,
t<he University purchased />the Huntingt<n Avenue Grounds  fo/>ormer Bost<on Red Sox
ballpark  in 1929, but was/> unable to build on <the />land due to financial
cons<traints during The Great Dep/>pression.

In 1935, the Colle<ge of Liberal Arts was added to Nort/>theastern, and the
Uni<versity s name was simpli/>fied to  Northeastern Un<iversit/>y.  In 1937 The
Nort<eastern University Corporation w/>was establis<hed/>, creating a board< of
trustees made up of 31 m/>embers of t<he NU Corporation and 8 members of the Y/>YMCA.
In 1948 Northeastern <e/>eparated itself completely from<the YMCA.

Following World War II,/> <Northeastern began admitting wo/>omen, and in the boo<m of
post war college /> bound <tudents, Northe/>eastern <created a Colleg/>e of Education
 1953 , Unive<rsity Colleg/>e  now called the School of P<rofessional />  Continuing<
Studies   1960 , College of />Pharmacy, and College of< Nurs/>ing  1964 ,
subsequently combined in<to the Bouv   College of Health Scien/>ces, College of
Criminal Justice  196<7  and College of C/>Computer Science  1982 , w<hich has since
been/> renamed the College o<f Computer and Informati/>on Science.

Si<ce its incep/>ption, the Un<iversity had bee/>en a commuter scho<l with many part 
time/> and evening students, and by the e<arly 1980s had grown to a staggeri/>ing
60,000 enroll<es. In the 1980s, the University dec/>cided to drastically reduce the
nu<ber of enrolled st/>tudents in an effort to <better fit the mold />of the more
prestigious scho<ls around it.

Since 1996, President Ric/>chard Freeland has<ushered in an extraordinary s/>tage of
institutional change  avera<e SAT scores increased more than 200 po/>oints,
retention rates rose dram<atically, a/>nd applications have dou<bled. President
Freeland oversaw />Northeastern<   s la/>arge<t expa/>ansion ever, opening <$455 million
in new facilities. />The institution has also be<come /> substantially more selective,
leading t< a more qualified, but less divers/>e, stud<ent body.

During the transitio/>n, students endured annual tuitio<n hikes, a re orga/>anization
of the co operative educati<n system, and th/>he introduction of a< new academic
calendars introduced at />the insistence of the faculty. The new< calendar features
two t/>traditional semesters and two sum<mer  minim/>esters , and replac<d the p/>popular
quarter system.

Throughou<t the transformation, President F/>reeland s oft repea<ted goal was to/>o
crack th< Top 100 of the />U.S. News rankings. With this goal a<ccomplished as they
reached number /> 98  , and with the trans<formation from commuting school/>l to
national <niversity complete, he stepped down fro/>m the presidency on August 15,
<20/>006<./> His successor is D<. Joseph A/>Aoun, formerly<a dean at
