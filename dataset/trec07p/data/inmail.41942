History

The Permian Basin, home to Monahans and Midland/Odessa MSA, is 250 miles wide
and 300 miles long   Monahans is  The Center of the Permian Basin . This area
was formed during the Permian Period, the final portion of the Paleozoic Era. At
the time, it was an abundant ocean filled with aquatic life. After this ocean
dried up, the decaying plants and animals formed the gigantic pools of oil and
gas the area is now known for.

In 1583, a Spanish explorer named Antonio de Espejo crossed this area on his way
through present day New Mexico. The Indians in the Monahans region were called
 Vaqueros  by these Spanish explorers because they hunted the  hump backed cow 
or bison. Records of Spanish exploring the Los Medano  the sand dunes  outside
Monahans can be traced to the early 1770s.

Located in a region where native Comanches, Mescalero, and Lipan Apache Indians
once roamed, Monahans  history as a community extends back to the late 1880s
with the expansion of the Texas and Pacific Railway across the south plains. For
the few people living in West Texas, the building of a transcontinental railroad
through the area meant the arrival of civilization. In the summer of 1881, Texas
and Pacific Railroad contracted with surveyor John Thomas Monahan, who
discovered that the lack of water for the laying crew and their animals would
slow down construction of the rail. Monahans  digging of a water well produced
an abundance of good water  250,000 gallons a day  and was instrumental in the
success of the city. Prior to this solution, water had to be hauled from the
area of Big Spring, Texas.

The availability of cheap land encouraged settlers to form a small community on
the track known as Monahans Well. However, when oil was discovered in the area
in 1926, the destiny of the community changed directions. Oil discovery brought
people of many occupations and of varied interests to Monahans. The local
economy began to change from an agricultural to an industrial economy,

Trivia Monahans is the home of the Million Barrel Oil Tank. Shell Oil Co.
constructed the tank in 1928 to hold crude oil waiting to be shipped. However,
because of leakage and evaporation, the tank was not effective and was
dismantled during the 1930s. It is now home of the Million Barrel Museum. Mules
hauled wood and cement to the site and the men worked around the clock for 90
days to construct the huge vessel in 1928.That was when oil first was discovered
in West Texas and was flowing about 500 barrels daily. You can visit the Million
Barrel Oil Musuem daily and learn more about the history of Monahans.

Thousands of tourists each year visit Monahans for the Sandhills State Park.
Sand Surfing and Sand football games can be seen between March and November
every year. Sandhills State Park is also host to many family picnics and youth
activities. In June, Sandhills State Park has been the site for weddings. Many
people visit the Sandhills at night to inquire about the famous but spooky  Lady
of Oil  legend.

Monahans is the hometown of legendary songwriter Guy Clark and it is mentioned
on a number of his songs as well as in his 1997 live album  Keepers  during a
musical interlude.

The /Unive

rsity of York/ is a campus university in York, England. Over 30
departments and centres co

ver a wide range of subjects in the arts, social
sciences, science and technology. A propo

rtion of the university/s teaching is
divided along collegiate lines/ some students also l

ive in college
accommodation.

The landscaped campus, constructed in the mid/1960s, is on 

the outskirts of the
medieval city, next to the village of Heslington. The campus is home 

to York
Science Park and the National Science Learning Centre. The university also uses
a 

number of historic buildings in the city centre.

Consistently ranked among the top ten un

iversities in the UK for teaching, York
also has a low dropout rate and an impressive repu

tation for academic research.

History

One of a series of new British universities, the U

niversity of York was opened
in 1963, admitting 200 students. At the time the university c

onsisted of three
buildings, principally King/s Manor /former residence of Thomas Wentwort

h, and
one/time headquarters of the Council of the North/ and Heslington Hall /former
resi

dence of Thomas Eynns, Secretary and Keeper of the Seal to the Council of
the North/. A ye

ar later, work began on the Heslington Campus /see below/, which
today forms the main part

 of the University.

There were several earlier proposals for the development of a univers

ity in
York. In 1903 F. J. Munby and others /including the Yorkshire Philosophical
Society

/ proposed a /Victoria University of Yorkshire/,/ref///ref/ whilst the
College of Ripon an

d York St John also considered purchasing Heslington Hall in
the past as part of a propose

d new campus.

Critical assessment In newspaper league tables, York ranks within the top t

en
universities in the UK, coming second in [[The Daily Telegraph]] university
league tabl

e in 2001, and, in 2003, [[The Sunday Times /UK//The Sunday Times]]
named it /University o

f the Year/. In 2006 the Sunday Times ranked York 7th in
its overall university league tab

les. It is also frequently at the top of
subject specific league tables. In official gover

nment assessments York has
regularly been ranked either first or second in the country for

 the quality of
its teaching. More state/school pupils come to York than any other leading


university, according to a recent study.

York has an impressive reputation for research 

with 18 subjects out of 23
receiving a rating of 5 and three 5/ ratings in the last Resear

ch Assessment
Exercise. York is a founder member of the World Universities Network WUN whi

ch
supports world/wide collaboration in teaching and research. In 2005 the
University was 

awarded the Queen/s Anniversary Prize for CNAP, the Centre for
Novel Agricultural products

 which explores the potential from the biosphere to
reduce the global economy/s dependence

 on fossil reserves and fuel./ref///ref/

There are around eight applications for every pl

ace and a very low dropout rate
of 4/ /only Oxbridge, Bristol, and UCL are lower/ref///ref

//.

Colleges The university is based on eight colleges, which provide accommodation
for s

tudents and some academic departments. In practice, the colleges fall
somewhere between th

e halls of residence seen in other UK universities and the
traditional Oxbridge colleges. 

By date of construction the colleges are/
/ Derwent, named after the River Derwent
/ Langw

ith, after Langwith Common and the abandoned village of Langwith
/ Alcuin, after Alcuin of

 York, a monk and scholar who became the adviser of
  Emperor Charlemagne
/ Vanbrugh, afte

r architect John Vanbrugh
/ Goodricke, after astronomer John Goodricke
/ Wentworth, now a 

post/graduate only college, after Earl Thomas Wentworth
/ James, /originally a graduate/on

ly college but admitted undergraduates in the
  academic year 1993/94/ after Lord James of

 Rusholme /the University/s first
  Vice Chancellor/
/ Halifax, originally Halifax Court, 

made a college in the academic year
  2001/02, after Lord Halifax

/Derwith, a shared exte

nsion of Derwent and Langwith colleges, on the other side
of University Road to both of it

s parents, was built in about 1988/

There are also several off/campus residences, includi

ng Constantine House,
Walmgate, and Fairfax House.

History

The Permian/>n Basin, home to Monahans and Mi<land/Odessa MSA, /> is 250 m<iles wid/>e
and 300 miles long   Monahans is <The Center of the Permian Basin . This/> area
was formed during the< Permian Period/>d, the final p<ortion of the Paleozoic Era. At
the />time, it was an abundan< ocean filled with a/>quatic life. After<this ocean
drie/>ed up, the<decaying plants and animals/> formed the gigantic pools< of oil and
gas the area is now known/> for.

In 1583, a Spanish <explorer named Antonio de/> Espejo crossed this a<rea on his way
through present day /> <ew Mexico. The Indians in the M/>Monahans region were called
<Vaqueros  by these Spanish e/>explorers because they hunted t<e  hump backed cow 
or biso/>on. Records of Spanish exploring the L<s Medano  the sand dunes  outside
M/>onahans can be traced to the <arly/>y 1770<.

Located in a region where native C/>omanche<s, Mescalero, and Lipan Apache In/>ndians
once roamed,< Monahans /> history as a <commu/>nity<extends back to the late 1880s
wi/>th the expansion of th< Texas and Pacific Railw/>way across the south pl<ins. /> For
the few <people living in West Texas, the />building of a transcontinental railroad<
through the area mea/>ant the arrival of <ivi/>lization. In <the su/>ummer of 1881, Texas
and Pacific<Railroad contr/>rac<ted with surveyor John Thomas Monahan/>, who
disc<vered that the lack of/> water for the laying crew a<nd their animals w/>woul<
slow down construction/>n of the rail. <onahans  digg/>ing of a water well produce<d
an abundance of good water/>r  250,000 gallons <a />day  and was instrumental< in/>n the
success of the city. P<rior to thi/>s solution,<water had to be hauled /> from the
area of Big <Spring, Texas.

/>
The availability of cheap land <encou/>uraged settle<rs to form a small communit/>ty on
the track known a< Monahans Well. However, when /> oil was <iscovered/>d in the area
in 1926, the destiny <f the community chang/>ged directions. Oil disc<overy brought
people of many occupat/>ions and of va<ied interests to Mon/>ahans. The loca<l
economy began to change f/>from an agricultural to an <ndustrial economy,

T/>Trivia Monahans<is the home of the Million Barrel Oil Ta/>ank< Sh/>ell Oil Co.
<onstructed the tank /> in 1928 to hol<d crude oil waiting to be />shipped. However,
becaus< of leakage and evap/>oration, the< tank was not /> effective and w<s
dismantled during the 1930s. It is /> now home of th< Million Barrel Museum. Mules
hauled wo/>od and ce<ent to the site and the men worked a/>around the clock<for 90
d/>days <to construct />the huge vessel in 1928.That was wh<n oil first was discovered
in Wes/>st Texas and was flowing about 500 bar<els daily. You can visit the Mil/>lion
Barrel Oil Musuem dail<y and learn more about the history of />Monaha<s.

Thousands of tourists ea/>ch yea<r /> visit Monahans for the Sandhills State< Park.
Sand Surfing and Sand football />games can be se<n betw/>ween March and November
eve<y year. Sandhills Sta/>ate Park is also ho<t to many family p/>icnics and youth
activitie<s. In June, Sandhills St/>tate Par<k has been th/>e sit<e for weddings. Many
people/>e visit the S<ndhil/>ls at night to inquir<e a/>bout th<e f/>famous but spooky  Lady
of Oil  legend<

Monahans is the hometown of l/>egendary songwriter Guy Clark and it <s mentioned
on a n/>numb<r of his song/>s as well as in his 1997 liv< albu/>um  Keepers  during a
