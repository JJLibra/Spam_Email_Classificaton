The  Zebra  is a part of the horse family, Equidae, native to central and
southern Africa. They are most well known for their distinctive black and white
stripes. The pronunciation is  ZEE bra  in North America or  ZEB rah  in the
United Kingdom.

Stripes


Zebras are white with black stripes as their underbelly is covered in white for
camouflage purposes.  ref Gould, S. J.  1983  Hen s Teeth and Horse s Toes 
Further Reflections in Natural History. New York  W. W. Norton and Company.
 blockquote In particular refer to Chapter 29  How the Zebra Gets Its Stripes.
One of the strongest pieces of evidence for black with white stripes, rather
than white with black stripes comes from abnormal zebras where the  stripes 
form as dots and blotches rather than lines. These appear as white blotches on a
black background, which is only understandable if it is normally a black animal
with white stripes. An interesting picture of this phenomenon can be found
[http //www.treknature.com/gallery/Africa/Kenya/photo33224.htm
here]. /blockquote  /ref  These stripes are typically vertical on the head,
neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on
the legs of the animal. The  zebra crossing  is named after the zebra s white on
black stripes.

Zoologists believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. This is
accomplished in several ways. First, the vertical striping helps the zebra hide
in grass. While seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither
white nor black, it is very effective against the zebra s main predator, the
lion, which is color blind. A zebra standing still in tall grass may not be
noticed at all by a lion and as zebras are herd animals the stripes help in
camouflage is by confusing the lion     a number of zebras standing or moving
close together may appear as one large animal, making it more difficult for the
lion to pick out any single zebra to attack. ref  /ref  A herd of zebras
scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused
mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult
for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its
herdmates.


Stripes are also believed to play a role in social interactions, with slight
variations of the pattern allowing the animals to distinguish between
individuals.

A more recent theory, supported by experiment, posits that the disruptive
coloration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the blood 
sucking tsetse fly. Alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with
fat patterning beneath the skin, serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the
zebra, and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly
indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.

African bushmen of Guinea refer to these stripes in their native Madango as
 sukuku  which means  lightning  and plays an important role in the customs of
the eastern region of Kankan. In ancient beliefs it was thought zebras were sent
by the spirit of lightning and rain to remind people that time changes, good
seasons of abundant fertility might turn out to be droughts, that giving life
may take another s life away, that black can t exist without white.

Species      Unsourced image removed      in South Africa.]] There are four
extant species, as well as several subspecies. Zebra populations vary a great
deal, and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the
subspecies are well known.

The Plains Zebra  Equus quagga, formerly Equus burchelli  is the most common,
and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and
eastern Africa. It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the
Common Zebra, the Dauw, Burchell s Zebra  actually the subspecies Equus quagga
burchelli , Chapman s Zebra, Wahlberg s Zebra, Selous  Zebra, Grant s Zebra,
Boehm s Zebra and the Quagga  another extinct subspecies, Equus quagga quagga .

The Mountain Zebra  Equus zebra  of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat
with a white belly and narrower stripes than the Plains Zebra. It has two
subspecies and is classified as endangered.

Grevy s Zebra  Equus grevyi  is the largest type, with an erect mane, and a
long, narrow head making it appear rather mule like. It is an inhabitant of the
semi arid grasslands of Ethiopia, Somalia, and northern Kenya. The Grevy s Zebra
is one of the rarest species of zebra around today, and is classified as
endangered.

Although zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. This
held true even when the Quagga and Burchell s race of Plains Zebra shared the
same area. According to Dorcas McClintock in  A Natural History Of Zebras, 
Grevy s zebra has 46 chromosomes  plains zebras have 44 chromosomes and mountain
zebras have 32 chromosomes. In captivity, Plains Zebras have been crossed with
mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the Plains Zebra
apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a
Grevy s zebra stallion to Mountain Zebra mares resulted in a high rate of
miscarriage.

// /Istanbul/ /, Greek/ , historically /[[Byzantium]]/ and later
/[[Constanti

nople]]// see other names/ is Turkey/s most populous city, and its
cultural and financial 

center. The city covers 25 districts of the Istanbul
province. It is located at 41// N 29/

/ E, on the Bosphorus strait, and
encompasses the natural harbor known as the Golden Horn,

 in the northwest of the
country. It extends both on the European /Thrace/ and on the Asia

n /Anatolia/
side of the Bosphorus, and is thereby the only metropolis in the world which 

is
situated on two continents. In its long history, Istanbul /Constantinople/
served as th

e capital city of the Roman Empire /330/395/, the Byzantine Empire
/395/1204 and 1261/1453

/, the Latin Empire /1204/1261/, and the Ottoman Empire
/1453/1922/. The city was chosen a

s joint European Capital of Culture for 2010.
The /Historic Areas of Istanbul/ were added 

to the UNESCO World Heritage List in
1985.

Names


The city of Istanbul has had many name

s throughout its history, depending on the
culture, language, and religion of its rulers. 

Byzantium, Constantinople, and
Stamboul are examples that may still be found in active use

 in certain
countries. Among others, it has been called New Rome or [[Second Rome]], since


the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great founded it on the site of the ancient
Greek city 

of Byzantium as a second, and decidedly Christian, capital of the
Roman Empire, in contras

t to the still largely pagan Rome./ref/R. Krautheimer,
/Three Christian Capitals/ Topograp

hy and Politics/. Berkeley, 1983//ref/ It has
also been nicknamed /The City on Seven Hills

/ because the historic peninsula,
the oldest part of the city, was built by Constantine on

 seven hills to match
the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented in the city coat 

of arms with
seven mosques, one at the top of each hill./ref///ref/ Another old nickname o

f
Istanbul is Vasileousa Polis /Queen of Cities/ due to its importance and wealth
througho

ut the Middle Ages. In an edict of March 28, 1930, the Turkish
authorities officially requ

ested foreigners to cease referring to the city with
their traditional non/Turkish names /

such as Constantinople/ and to adopt
//stanbul as the sole name also in the foreign langua

ges./ref/Stanford and Ezel

History




The first human settlement in Istanbul, the Fikirtepe m

ound on the Anatolian
side, is from the Chalcolithic period, with artifacts dating from 55

00/3500 BC.
A port settlement dating back to the Phoenicians has been discovered in nearby


Kad//k//y /Chalcedon/. Cape Moda in Chalcedon was the first location which the
Greek sett

lers of Megara chose to colonize in 685 BC, prior to colonising
Byzantion on the European 

side of the Bosphorus under the command of King Byzas
in 667 BC. Byzantion was established

 on the site of an ancient port settlement
named Lygos, founded by Thracian tribes between

 the 13th and 11th centuries BC,
along with the neighbouring
Semistra,/ref/[http///www.new

advent.org/cathen/04301a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia/
Constantinople]//ref/ of which Plinius

 had mentioned in his historical accounts.
Only a few walls and substructures belonging to

 Lygos have survived to date,
near the Seraglio Point /Turkish/ Sarayburnu/, where the fam

ous Topkap// Palace
now stands. During the period of Byzantion, the Acropolis used to stan

d where
the Topkap// Palace stands today.

After siding with Pescennius Niger against the 

victorious Septimius Severus the
city was besieged by Rome and suffered extensive damage i

n AD 196. Byzantium was
rebuilt by the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus and quickly regaine

d its previous
prosperity, being temporarily renamed as Augusta Antonina by the emperor, i

n
honor of his son.

The location of Byzantium attracted Constantine the Great in 324 afte

r a
prophetic dream was said to have identified the location of the city/ but the
true rea

son behind this prophecy was probably Constantine/s final victory over
Licinius at the Bat

tle of Chrysopolis ///sk//dar/ on the Bosphorus, on September
18, 324, which ended the civ

il war between the Roman Co/Emperors, and brought an
end to the final vestiges of the Tetr

archy system, during which Nicomedia /present/
day //zmit, 100 km east of Istanbul/ was th

e most senior Roman capital city.
Byzantium /now renamed as [[New Rome/Nova Roma]] which e

ventually became
[[Constantinople/Constantinopolis]], i.e. The City of Constantine/ was
of

ficially proclaimed the new capital of the Roman Empire six years later, in
330. Following

The  Zebra  is a part of the horse f<mily, Equidae, native to c/>central and

Stripes


Zebras are white wi/>ith black stripes as their underbel<ly is covered in white for
c/>amouflage purposes<.  ref Gould, S/>. J.  1983  H<en s Teeth /> and Horse s Toes 
<urther/> R<eflections in Natural History. New York/>  W. W. Norton and Company.
 blo<ckquote In pa/>rticular refer to Chapter 29  Ho< the Zebra Gets Its Stripes.
One of t/>he strongest pieces of <evi/>idence for black <ith white stripes, rather
than white wit/>th black stripes< comes from abnormal zebras where the  />stripes 
form as dots and blotches ra<ther than />lin<es. These appear as white blotches on a
/>black background, whic< is only understan/>ndable if it is no<mally a black animal
with white /> stri<es/>s. An intere<ti/>ing picture of this phenomenon ca< be found
[/>[http //www.treknature.com/<allery/Africa/Kenya/ph/>oto33224.htm
here]. </blockquote  /ref/>  These stripes are typically ve<rtical on the />head,
neck, for<quarters, and main body, with /> horizont<l stri/>ipes at th< rear and on
the legs of the anim/>al. The  zebra crossing<  is named after the zebra s white on
bl/>lac< stripes.

Zoologist/>ts <elieve that the stripes act as a ca/>amouflage mechan<ism. This is
acco/>mplished in sev<ral w/>ways. First, the <vertical striping helps the zebra />hide
in grass. While s<eming/>g absurd at first glance c<nsidering that grass i/>s nei<ther
whit/>e nor black, it is very ef<fective against the zebra s main />predator, the
lion, whic<h is color blind. A zebra/>a standing still in tall grass may no<t b/>e
noticed at<al/>ll by a lion and as< zebras are herd animals th/>h< stripe/>es h<lp in
camouflage is by confu/>sing the lion  <   a/>a number of zebr<s standing or moving
/>
close tog<ther may appear as one large an/>nimal, making it more difficult fo< the
lion to pick out any sing/>gle zebra to attack. ref  </ref  A herd of zeb/>bras
scattering to a<oid a predator will also represent to/>o that predator a confu<ed
mass of vertical stripe/>s trave<lling in mu/>ltiple directions making it d<ifficult
for the predator to track an/> individua<l visually as it separates/> from its
herdmates.


Strip<s /> are also be<ieved to play/>y a ro<le in socia/>l interactions, with slight
va<riations of the pattern allowing the a/>animals to dist<nguish between
individuals.

A more r/>ecent theory, suppor<ted by experiment,/> posits that the disruptive
coloratio<n is/>s also an effective means of conf<using the visual/> system of the blood 
sucking tsetse fly<. Alternative theories include tha/>at the <tripes coincide /> with
fat patt<erning beneath the skin/>, serving as a thermoregulatory me<chanism for the
zebra, and/>d that w<unds sustain/>ed disrupt the <striping />pattern to clearl<
indicate/>e the fitness of the animal to potenti<l m/>mates.

African bushmen of Gui<ea refer /> to these stripe< in their native Madango as
 sukuk/>ku  which means  lightning  and pla<ys an important role in the cust/>oms of
the eastern region <f Kankan. In ancient bel/>liefs it was thought z<bras/>s were sent
by t<he spirit of lightning/> and< rain/> to remind people tha<t time changes, good/>
seasons of abundant fertility m<ight turn out to be droughts, tha/>t giving life
may take another s life <way, that black can t exist without whi/>te.

Species      Unsourced image re<moved      in South Africa/>a.]] There are four
extant species,<as well as several subspeci/>ies. Zebra populations<vary a great
deal, and the relationshi/>ips <betwe/>en and the< ta/>xonomic status of several of the<subspecies are well known/>n.

The Plains Zebra  Equus quagga, <ormerly Equus bur/>chelli  is the most common<
and has or had about twelve subspecie/>es distributed across much of<southern and
eastern Africa. I/>It, or particular subsp<cies of it, have also been known as t/>the
Common Zebra, the Dauw, Bu<rchell s Z/>ebra  actually the subspecies Equus qua<ga
burchelli , Chapman s /> Zebra, Wahl<erg s Zebra, Selou/>us  Zebra, Grant s Zebra,
Boeh< s Zebra and the Quagga  another e/>x<inct subspecies, Equus qu/>uagga quagga .

The Mounta<n/>n Zebra  Equus zebra  of southwest Afr<ca tends to have a sleek coat
with a wh/>ite< belly/> and narrower stripes than the Plain<s Zebra. It has two
subsp/>ecies and is <classified as />endangered.<

Grevy s Zebra  Equus grevyi  is the/> largest type, with an er<ct mane, and a
long, narrow head making/>g it appear rather mul< like. It/>t is <an inha/>bitant of the<semi arid /> grasslands of Ethiopia, Soma<ia, and />northern Kenya. The Grevy s Ze<bra
is one/> of the rarest specie<s of zebra aroun/>d today, and is classified as
end<angered.

Although zebra spe/>ecies may have overlapping ranges, t<hey do not interbreed. Th/>is<held true even when the Quagga and B/>urchell s race of Plai<ns Zebra shared the
same a/>area. According to Dorcas M<Clintock in  A Natu/>ural History Of Zebras, 
Grevy s zebra h<s 46 chromosomes  plains zebras hav/>ve 44 ch<omosomes and mountain
zebras have 32 /> ch<romosomes. In captivity, Plai/>ins Zebras have been crossed with
mou<tain zebras/>. The hybrid foa<ls lacked a dewlap and />resembled the Plains Zebra
apart fro<m their larg/>ger ears a<d their hindquarters pattern/>n. Attempts t<o breed a
Grevy s zebra />stallion to Mou<ntai/>in Zebra mares r<sulted in a high rate of
miscarriage.
