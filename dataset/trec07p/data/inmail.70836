Imagine being  part     of     a      stable organization with      a       sterling      reputation   -       a   place     where     the  Sydney   Car   Centre is       an   integral  part    of   all      that we  do. With   our      car      centre    personality,   you'll       not       just     succeed      - you'll     thrive.    And, with our     strong     commitment    to    promoting from    within, you'll     definitely      enjoy  your     rise     to the      top.<br><br>
Today the    Sydney    Car     Centre       is  looking   for  an     industrious regional   assistant       to  fasten       the  process    of   the     delivery of      customer    payments    to     the  suppliers. The     position       offered  is  a   part-time      job,       and     will   only  require    from      you       to be     available   for 1-2      hours      a     day.<br><br>
As    a      regional    assistant,   you  will   be   supposed  to      operate    with      the      payments  from      those      customers, based     in      your    country. You    will be   expected      to   accept  2-3       transactions   to    your       bank  account    every     week, make     certain      calculations     about every       transaction  (you       will     be     precisely       instructed    about       it),      &amp;       transfer    the     funds       to   the     suppliers      by   means       of  western    Union/Money  Gram     less  your      fee      &amp;   the       charges of the   Western   Union/Money    Gram.    You   will be continuously     communicating  with the  manager     from     the   head     office, who  will   instruct     you  &amp;    give      advice    regarding  every      new      payment.<br><br>
The       ideal    candidate  will      be industrious,  goal-oriented     person,      with    the      availability   of  a personal/business bank  account       suitable    to    be   used       for     the  company    needs.  Knowledge of      English,       computer       literacy    and   sociability  are       appreciated.<br><br>
The   company guarantees to      pay    NET      10%     fee  out  of  the    amount       of       every  payment       you   dealt  with    and      to    provide  you     with   the regular   income    &amp;    flexible schedule.  All  the     related      expenses     you     might       have (like      the       Western       Union/Money Gram  chargers,      related    expenses   on traveling)  are covered      by      the   company.<br><br>
