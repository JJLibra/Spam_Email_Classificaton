Dear valued member.
It’s your therapist’s assistant writing to you. I just wanted to give you some really useful advice on how to shop for drugs online.
Be careful when choosing where to buy your meds from – try to cling to pharmacies that have already made a good name for themselves, such as USDrugs. Always make sure that your online drugstore is a licensed one.
Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions concerning the information provided.
