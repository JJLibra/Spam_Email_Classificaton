Analysis of Lock Usage LockLint's primary role is to report on lock
usage inconsistencies that may lead to data races and deadlocks.
Even with this analysis, there are limits to what LockLint can make
sense of.
It is extremely important for a meaningful analysis that LockLint have
the correct call graph for the code to be analyzed.
NFKC Normalization Form Compatibility Composition.
at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.
Normalizer class defines the isNormalized method, which checks whether a
given character sequence is normalized according to one of the four
normalization forms. If a domain name contains non-ASCII characters, it
must be normalized to the NFKC form. Order assertions specify the order
in which the given locks must be acquired. Characters are decomposed by
compatibility equivalence then recomposed by canonical equivalence. The
method returns a non-zero result when errors occur.
Tim Bray, co-creator of XML, talks about the significance of Sun's open
source efforts     DON'T MISS THIS!
Annotations provide a good way to document your program.
Because the characters are  visually distinguishable and have additional
semantic information, the characters are not canonically equivalent.
Note - These specifications may also be conveyed using source code
annotations. Remember that you cannot run analyze twice for a given
state, so it will probably help to save the state of LockLint using the
save subcommand before running analyze.
It's almost too easy.
To print out existing constraints, use the reallows and disallows
subcommands. The LockLint database for each source file is stored in a
separate file.
