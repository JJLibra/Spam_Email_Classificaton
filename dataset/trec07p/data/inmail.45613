Dear customer.CanadianPharmacy is one of very few online stores that sell generic medications only. Don't waste too much on what can cost less."High price proves the high quality of the drug" That's what all Web pharmacies say in their ads. All except CanadianPharmacy. Drug sales tax is much lower here in Canada so we don't have any trouble dumping our rivals into tears. CanadianPharmacy generic quality CAN be cheap.CanadianPharmacy the only Canadian Web pharmacy to be recommended by FDA.Yours,Flossie Belcher
