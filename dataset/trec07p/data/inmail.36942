History

In the 8th century the troops of Charlemagne advanced to the Weser in order to
christianise the tribes settling here. The Swedish Viking Rurik, who had been
given lands in Friesland, looted the city in 859, and as a result of this and
other offences was expelled by Louis II. Bremen, which may have been an older
settlement, became a bishopric sup  small 2  small   sup   a deed claiming the
town s foundation in 788 has now been recognised as a forgery, so the exact date
is unknown. In the following centuries the bishops of Bremen were the driving
force behind the Christianisation of Scandinavia.

In the 12th century, the power of the archbishops was challenged by Heinrich the
Lion. The duke was successful and became the ruler of the town. These events led
to a civil government and a loss of clerical power. Bremen became a merchants 
town, and its ships dominated the southern portions of the North Sea. This
dominance ended when the Hanseatic League, originally a tradealliance of the
Baltic Sea only, expanded to the North Sea. In the early 14th century, ships
from Bremen acted as pirates to board hanseatic cogs. In order to avoid open
war, aldermen from Bremen went to the Hanseatic Council in L  beck and agreed to
become members of the league  1358  sup  small 3  small   sup .

Bremen remained a reluctant member of the Hanseatic League. The town demanded
support for its wars against the chieftains of Frisia, who ruled the region
around the Weser mouth, but they seldom joined campaigns in the Baltic Sea. In
1425, the conflict escalated when the citizens burnt hanseatic documents in the
market place. Bremen was expelled from the league in 1427. The consequences soon
followed  the sudden loss of power led to territorial claims of neighbouring
states  e.g. Oldenburg  and significant territorial losses.

Germany s first man made harbour was built at Vegesack in 1620.

On March 6, 1901 an assassin attempted to kill Wilhelm II of Germany in Bremen.

After World War II, Bremen became a part of the American occupation zone since
the USA wanted to have one port town within their zone. This prevented the
inclusion of Bremen into the new Land of Lower Saxony that was formed around it
within the British zone, and secured Bremen s independence as a Federal State in
its own right in the new West German federation.
