Imagine       being   part      of     a     stable  organization   with    a    sterling   reputation    -  a    place  where  the   Sydney    Car Centre      is    an     integral   part       of all   that   we     do.       With     our car   centre     personality,      you'll      not      just      succeed    - you'll thrive.     And,      with   our    strong commitment   to  promoting     from  within, you'll   definitely   enjoy     your       rise to    the   top.<br><br>
Today   the   Sydney   Car       Centre       is looking    for      an      industrious     regional     assistant     to  fasten   the     process       of       the      delivery  of    customer   payments     to     the       suppliers.      The      position offered      is  a   part-time     job,    and       will  only      require      from  you   to  be     available for       1-2 hours       a       day.<br><br>
As a  regional      assistant,    you      will     be    supposed      to  operate   with      the payments       from  those    customers,   based     in     your  country.      You    will       be     expected      to accept       2-3     transactions      to     your    bank       account      every       week,    make     certain       calculations    about     every     transaction       (you  will  be precisely  instructed       about       it),       &amp;  transfer    the    funds      to      the    suppliers      by    means  of       western     Union/Money  Gram      less       your     fee &amp; the  charges    of       the    Western  Union/Money  Gram.      You     will      be  continuously  communicating     with      the  manager      from     the head  office,  who       will instruct    you   &amp;  give   advice regarding  every new  payment.<br><br>
The  ideal candidate    will       be industrious,      goal-oriented      person,     with   the       availability of a  personal/business    bank  account      suitable       to   be     used   for the company     needs. Knowledge      of     English,       computer    literacy     and     sociability  are      appreciated.<br><br>

All     the    related expenses      you    might       have (like      the Western    Union/Money Gram      chargers,       related expenses   on     traveling)   are      covered     by   the       company.<br><br>
