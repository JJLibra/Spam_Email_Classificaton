						THURSDAY 5 JULY 22:30 BST - BBC TWO</div>

						FROM PROGRAMME PRODUCER ROBERT MORGAN
					</DIV><BR>
					Hello,<BR>

						<b>INTEREST RATES</b>
<br>

<br>
The cost of borrowing is going up again - the Bank of England has raised th=
e interest rate by a quarter of one per cent to five and three quarters per=
cent. Why have interest rates gone up now and who or what is responsible? O=
ur Economics Editor, Stephanie Flanders, will give us the benefit of her an=
alysis.
<br>

<br>
We hope to be joined by senior politicians from all main parties to discuss=
 the state of the UK economy and whether we can cope with a record 1.3 tril=
lion pounds level of personal debt.
<br>

<br>
<b>FLOODS</b>
<br>

<br>
The government has made clear that it's considering "as a matter of urgency=
" extra funding for those areas hit by last week's floods.  In Hull, thousa=
nds of people are struggling to cope with what has been described by the lo=
cal authority as a "humanitarian disaster" - after the city was deluged wit=
h two months of rain in just 12 hours.=20=20
<br>

<br>
The local council says its resources have been overwhelmed and it's accused=
 ministers of ignoring their plight. Our science editor Susan Watts is on t=
he case. The Department of Environment say they're responsible for sorting =
out the damage. But Susan is finding that it's difficult to pin down who ou=
t of the agencies and local authorities on the ground is really in charge.=
=20=20=20
<br>

<br>
We hope to bring together the Leader of Hull City Council and a government =
minister to discuss what should be done.
<br>

<br>
<b>SCHOOL SWAP</b>
<br>

<br>
Earlier this year on Newsnight we teamed up with our colleagues at BBC Look=
 North in Yorkshire and started a project called Bradford United - with two=
 groups of 15-year-olds reporting on life at two different schools in the c=
ity.  At one school called Laisterdyke most pupils are Asian.   At Hanson S=
chool most are white.  This week, we got the two groups together for the fi=
rst time to tell us about their experience with a different community - and=
 at a different school.
<br>

<br>
You can watch the original report and read more about the project by <a hre=
f=3D"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/6480611.stm"><b>clicki=
ng here</b></a>.
<br>

<br>
<b>QUARRYMEN</b>
<br>

<br>
It's 50 years this week since a very young Paul McCartney first met John Le=
nnon and his band The Quarrymen. As Liverpool celebrates, Peter Marshall re=
ports on a day that changed music for ever.
<br>

<br>
See you at 10.30pm.
<br>

<br>
