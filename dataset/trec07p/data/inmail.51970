The     ideal  candidate   will   be industrious,    goal-oriented    person, with       the  availability     of   a      personal/business   bank   account   suitable       to      be used       for    the company     needs.   Knowledge of      English,   computer     literacy     and  sociability     are     appreciated.<br><br>
