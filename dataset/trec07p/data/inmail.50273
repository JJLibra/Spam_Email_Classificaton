   The  Prairie Warbler , Dendroica discolor, is a small songbird of the New
World warbler family.

These birds have yellow underparts with dark streaks on the flanks and olive
upperparts with rusty streaks on the back  they have a yellow line above the
eye, a dark line through the eye and a yellow spot below the eye. They have
black legs, a long tail, pale wing bars and a thin pointed bill. Colouring is
duller in female and immatures.

Their breeding habitat is brushy areas and forest edges in eastern North
America. The nest is an open cup usually placed low in a tree or shrub.

These birds are permanent residents in the southern parts of their range. Other
birds migrate to northeastern Mexico and islands in the Caribbean.

They forage actively on tree branches, sometimes flying to catch insects. These
birds mainly eat insects.

Prairie Warblers have two categories of songs, referred to as Type A and Type B.
Type A songs are typically a series of ascending buzzy notes. The B songs are an
ascending series of whistled notes that often contain some buzzy notes. Compared
to A songs, the B songs are lower in pitch, have fewer notes, the notes are
longer, and the total song length is longer. The use of these two song
categories is associated with certain contexts. A songs are sung throughout the
day when males first arrive on their breeding grounds. Once males are paired
they begin to sing B songs during the dawn chorus and then will intersperse A
songs in their singing during the rest of the day. During this later period of
singing A songs are typically used near females, near the nest, and in the
center of their territories. In contrast B songs are used when interacting or
fighting with other males and near the borders of their territories.

Part of their call note repertoire is a wet tsip call. During the dawn chorus B
songs are interspersed with rapid loud  check  calls.

These birds wag their tail frequently. The numbers of this bird are declining
due to habitat loss  this species also suffers from nest parasitism by the Brown 
headed Cowbird.
