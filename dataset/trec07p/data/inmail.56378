    To Kill a Mockingbird  is a Southern Gothic bildungsroman novel by Harper
Lee. Published in 1960, To Kill a Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.
The novel is loosely based on the lives of various friends and members of the
author s family, but with differing character names. Lee has acknowledged that
the character Jean Louise  Scout  Finch, who serves as the novel s narrator, is
somewhat based on herself.

To Kill a Mockingbird contains many themes such as selfishness, hatred, courage,
pride, prejudice, and life s many stages, set against a backdrop of life in the
Deep South. The book was successfully adapted for film by director Robert
Mulligan with a screenplay by Horton Foote in 1962. To date, it is Lee s only
published novel.

Plot overview The novel is a coming of age story about a sister and a brother
named Jean Louise  Scout  Finch and Jeremy Atticus  Jem  Finch respectively, who
are growing up in the fictional small town of Maycomb, Alabama, in the Deep
South of America in the 1930s. The story takes place over a period of three
years and is told through the recollections of the younger sister, Jean Louise
Finch or  Scout , as she is commonly referred to by friends. During the story
the children s father, attorney Atticus Finch, is appointed to defend a black
man  Tom Robinson  who has been accused of raping a white girl  Mayella Ewell .

Explanation of the novel s title After giving Jem and Scout air rifles as
Christmas presents, Atticus warns the children that, although they can  shoot
all the bluejays [they] want,  they must remember that  it s a sin to kill a
mockingbird . Ms Maudie Atkinson, the children s neighbor, later explains that
it is a sin because mockingbirds do no harm. They only provide pleasure with
their songs   They don t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us . The
mockingbird is used as a recurri</STYLE>
