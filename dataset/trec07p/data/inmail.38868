A  barber   from the Latin barba,  beard   is someone whose occupation is to cut
any type of hair, give shaves, and trim beards. In previous times, barbers also
performed surgery and dentistry. In more recent times, with the development of
safety razors and the increasing popularity of cleanshaven men, most barbers
primarily cut hair.

Therefore, although many may still deal with facial hair when requested, the
predominant difference in American and Commonwealth culture is that barbers
specialize in the simple cutting of men s hair. They do not generally offer
significant styling or  fancy  haircuts when compared to hairdressers working in
hair salons. In recent years, larger numbers of women have been going to a
barber for their haircuts, especially when they choose to have their hair cut
very short or shaved primarily due to the generally lower cost of barbershops.

The place where a barber works is generally called a barbershop  or  barber
shop  .

Often barbers who wish to only cut hair will work in barber shops. Some Master
Barbers prefer to see them selves as hairdressers and work in a salon. There is
a common misbelief that barbers do not perform any service other than hair
cutting and that cosmetologists perform all coloring and perms but this is
untrue. Many working stylists are legally Master Barbers.

History The barber s trade is an extremely ancient one. Razors have been found
among relics of the Bronze Age  circa 3500 BC  in Egypt, and barbering is
mentioned in the Bible by Ezekiel who said  Now, son of man, take a sharp sword
and use it as a barber s razor to shave your head and your beard.  NIV  

Shaving, either of the head or face, was not always a voluntary act, for it has
been enforced by law in England and elsewhere. Cleanliness and vanity were
therefore not the sole reasons for a  clean shave   the origins lie deeper.
Before the Macedonian conquest brought the custom of clean shaving, the
               in the Greek [[agora]] would trim and style his patrons  beards,
hair, and fingernails, as gossip and debate flowed freely.

Barbering was introduced to Rome from the Greek colonies in Sicily in 296 B.C.
and barber shops quickly became very popular centres for daily news and gossip.
All free men of Rome then had to be clean shaven while slaves were forced to
wear beards. A morning visit to the tonsor became a part of the daily routine as
important as the visit to the public baths, and a young man s first shave
 tonsura  was an essential part of his coming of age ceremony. around 1842. Wood
engravement. As shown in this image, the barbershop also provides an opportunity
for social contacts.]]

A few Roman tonsores became wealthy and influential, running shops that were
favorite loci publici of high society  most were simple tradesmen, owning small
storefronts or setting up their stool in the street and offering shaves for a
mere [[quadrans]]. Some had reputations as clumsy butchers who left their
patrons scarred about the cheeks and chin  their dull bronze or copper  never
steel  razors must share some of the blame. The better barbers offered
depilatories for those customers who refused the razor.

When Julius Caesar landed in Britain in 54 B.C. he found that the Britons wore
no facial hair at all, except on the upper lip. Similarly, at the time of the
Norman Conquest, Harold and his men also had their chins  reaped  as the Saxons
termed it  an expression no longer in use except by the harvester. Full beards
came back into fashion during the reign of the Hellenophile Hadrian.

The barbers of former times were also surgeons and dentists. Most early
physicians disdained surgery as well as haircutting, hairdressing and shaving,
barbers performed surgery of wounds, blood letting, cupping and leeching,
enemas, and the extraction of teeth. Thus they were called barber surgeons and
they formed their first organisation in 1094.

Barbers were chartered as a guild by Edward IV in 1462 as  The Company of
Barbers . The surgeons formed a guild 30 years later and the two companies were
subsequently united by a statute of Henry VIII in 1540 under the name of  The
United Barber Surgeons Company . During the reign of Henry VIII the authorities
of Lincolns Inn prohibited wearers of beards from sitting unless they paid
certain penalties. Elizabeth I went one better  in her reign a law was passed
that the wearer of a beard of more than two weeks  growth should be taxed
according to his station in life   a man in a lowly position was taxed to the
extent of 3s. 4d. per annum for growing whiskers  So taken was Peter the Great
with this enactment that he introduced the law into Russia.

 Ottoman barber s apron]] In Ireland it was enacted that, in order to be
 recognised as an Englishman, a man must have all the hair above his mouth
 shaven. This law remained in force for two hundred years.

In 1745 surgeons were separated from barbers by acts passed during the reign of
George II. The surgeons got the title</STYLE>
