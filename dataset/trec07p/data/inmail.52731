Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.



Erectile dysfunction (ED), 

sometimes referred 

to as impotence, is the inability 
for a sexually active male to obtain 



and sustain an erection for sexual

 purposes. In the past, this has been 

very embarrassing for


 men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 
and, in fact, there has been very

 little diagnostic testing or treatment



 options available until very recently.
