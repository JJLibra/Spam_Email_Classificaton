Right, but the issues present in the current version of the license
are also present in the versions which we are distributing.

The underlined section is the important point. I'm almost certain that
Dave Coffin intends for the software to be free, but the dissonance
between the copyright statement in ddraw.c and the DFSG has to be
resolved.

[It's also not clear whether free applies to the ability to modify or
whether it merely means that you don't have to pay; licencing under
the GPL or MIT/Expat would resolve these questions as far as I'm
concerned.]

Yes; both issues came up in the context of re-examining the entire
license, though. I've only prsented the entire new license in the bug
report, since that was what the original question was about.

In any event, let me know if you need any assistance or clarification
in your communication with Dave.
