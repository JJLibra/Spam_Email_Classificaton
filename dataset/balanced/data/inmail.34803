 Somalia      , officially the  Somali Republic   ,   and formerly known as the
 Somali Democratic Republic , is located on the Horn of Africa in East Africa.
It is bordered by Djibouti to the north west, Kenya on its south west, the Gulf
of Aden with Yemen on its north, the Indian Ocean at its east and Ethiopia to
the west. The Somali state currently exists solely in a [[de jure]] capacity 
Somalia has no recognized central government authority nor any other feature
associated with an established independent state. De facto authority resides in
the hands of the governments for the unrecognized entities of Somaliland and
Puntland and the United Nations recognized, interim Transitional Federal
Government  TFG , which until recently controlled only Baidoa. Violence has
plagued Mogadishu, the capital, since warlords ousted former President Mohamed
Siad Barre in 1991.

History

]] Somalia has been continuously inhabited by numerous and varied ethnic groups,
some of Oromo or other cushitic ancestry, but the majority were Somalis, for the
last 2,500 years. From the first century C.E. numerous ports like ancient Opone
and ancient Mosylon Bandar Gori were trading with Roman and Greek sailors. The
northwestern part of Somalia was part of the Kingdom of Aksum from about the 3rd
century to the 7th. By the early medieval period
 C.E. nbsp 700 ndash C.E. nbsp 1200 , Islam became firmly established especially
with the founding of Mogadishu in C.E. nbsp 900. The late medieval period  C.E. nbsp 1201 
C.E. nbsp 1500  saw the rise of numerous Somali city states and kingdoms. In
northwestern Somalia, the Sultanate of Adal  a multi ethnic state comprised of
Afars, Somalis and Hararis  with Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al Ghazi as their leader in
the 1520, successfully led a campaign which saw three quarters of Ethiopia
coming under Adal rule before being defeated by a joint Ethiopian Portuguese
force at the Battle of Wayna Daga on February 21, 1543. The Ajuuraan Sultanate
flourished in the 14th and 17th centuries. Following the collapse of Adal and
Ajuuraan in the early and late 17th century, Somalia saw the growth and gradual
rise of many successor city states such as the Sultanates of eastern Sanag, of
Bari, and of Hobyo. The modern period began when the clouds of colonial conquest
gathered in 1884.

Colonial period a statue in honor of  Sayyid Abdullah Hassan  and his favourite
horse  Hiin Faniin  was erected in Mogadishu.]] The year 1884 Abokar ended a
long period of comparative peace. At the Berlin Conference of 1884, the Scramble
for Africa started the long and bloody process of the imperial partition of
Somali lands. The French, British and Italians came to Somalia in the late 19th
century.

The British claimed British Somaliland as a protectorate in 1886 after the
withdrawal of Egypt and the treaty with Warsangeli clan. Egypt sought to prevent
European colonial expansion in Northeast Africa. The southern area, claimed by
Italy in 1889, became known as Italian Somaliland. The northernmost stretch
became part of the French Territory of Afars and Issas, also known as French
Somaliland, until it later achieved independence as Djibouti.
