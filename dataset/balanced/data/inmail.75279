the name 'Gmail' for its popular webmail service following a trademark
suit filed by the founder of G-Mail. Daniel Giersch, started using the
name G-Mail in 2000, four years before Google released 'Gmail'. "Google

[0]Roland Piquepaille writes "According to the Ludington Daily News,
Michigan, Danish agricultural engineers have built [1]a robot to help
farmers with weeds. The Hortibot is about 3-foot-by-3-foot, is
self-propelled, and uses global positioning system (GPS). It can
recognize 25 different kinds of weeds and eliminate them by using its
weed-removing attachments. It's also very environmentally friendly
because it can reduce herbicide usage by 75 percent. But so far, it's
only a prototype and the Danish engineers need to find a manufacturer for
distribution."

Gammu writes "The inventor of the compact disc, [0]the most popular
medium in the world for playing back and storing music, is often disputed
as one individual did not invent every part of the compact disc. The most
attributed inventor is James Russell, who in 1965 was inspired with a
revolutionary idea as he sketched on paper a more ideal music recording
system to replace vinyl records; Russell envisioned a system which could
record and replay sounds without any physical contact between parts."

[0]Steve Jones writes "With the EU being rumored to look at software
patents again I thought I'd have a look at the root of the problem — the
US Patent Office — and work out if there is [1]a simple way to defeat
dumb patents. The big thing that defeats a patent is prior art. At the
Patent Office they have the definition of Prior Art that includes the
phrase: 'known or used by others in this country, or was patented or
described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country.' Now
suppose that every time we have an idea that we think is 'obvious' but
that hasn't been done before, or something we think would be interesting
but don't have the money to create — that we blogged about that idea,
tagging it as 'prior art' via [2]Technorati. This would give people an
[3]RSS feed of prior art." Read on for more details of Steve's proposal.

of Dell's size to be "toning down its sales pitch for Microsoft's Vista
operating system" — particularly because "one of the issues the hardware
vendor is warning business about is the extra hardware they will need to
buy." Quoting: "'They need to be looking at the number of images they
will be installing and the size of these images,' said Dell's European
client services business manager, Niall Fitzgerald. 'A 2GB image for each
user will have a big impact.'"

An anonymous reader lets us know of developments in a case in Belgium
that has been under litigation since 2004. The Belgian copyright watchdog
SABAM has [0]forced an ISP to begin filtering P2P traffic (PDF).
According to the PDF on the SABAM site: "The Belgian Society of Authors,
Composers and Publishers (SABAM) has just won an important legal battle
within the context of the dispute that opposes it to the Internet Service
Provider (ISP) Tiscali, which has become Scarlet Extended Ltd. In its
sentence of June 29, 2007, the Court of First Instance of Brussels is
demanding from the access provider that it adopts one of the technical
measures put forward by the expert in order to prevent Internet users
from illegally downloading SABAM's musical repertoire via P2P software."
The rumor is that Scarlet will be forced to deploy the same software as
MySpace uses ([1]Audible Magic) to filter illegal P2P traffic from the
legal.

shows promise as an alternative to batteries for applications where
frequent battery replacement would not be feasible. The devices are
currently being used in industry where 'there is the potential for
embedding sensors in previously inaccessible locations,' but its creators
imagine it could be used in devices such as pacemakers, where the beating
of the heart would produce ample movement to power the magnetic
mechanism."

anonymity, purchased songs with his existing credit from the allTunes
software client today and experienced no trouble doing so... AllofMP3's
six million users will no doubt be delighted they can use their leftover
credit to purchase songs, but the site's longevity hangs in the balance.
Just days after the Russian Government shut down AllofMP3.com, its sister
site, MP3Sparks.com, suffered the same fate."

slower 2.0GHz Barcelona is due soon AMD didn't think results from the 2.0
would look good enough — even against the slower Xeons they picked. Maybe
the right comparison should be either best cpu against best cpu — or
compare ones at the same price — and only shipped products."

[0]tregetour writes with a link to a New York Times article penned by
David Pogue about a quiet announcement last week by T-Mobile. It has
nothing to do with the iPhone, but it could still be a welcome revolution
for users plagued by high cellphone bills. "Here's the basic idea. If
you're willing to pay $10 a month on top of a regular T-Mobile voice
plan, you get a special cellphone. When you're out and about, it works
like any other phone; calls eat up your monthly minutes as usual. But
when it's in a Wi-Fi wireless Internet hot spot, this phone offers a huge
bargain: [1]all your calls are free. You use it and dial it the same as
always — you still get call hold, caller ID, three-way calling and all
the other features — but now your voice is carried by the Internet rather
than the cellular airwaves." He goes on to explain further benefits of
the system, and describes the wireless routers that the company will be
pushing with the service. The only thing missing: an estimate of when it
will hit stores.

An anonymous reader writes "The Chinese capital city of Beijing is now
[0]a global leader in distributing viruses. According to UK-based managed
security services company Network Box, Beijing accounts for 40 percent of
all viruses that passed though the company's servers in June, and 5.25
percent of detected spam. This compares with slightly lower percentages
for cities in countries noted for having a malware problem. Moscow was
second for spam with 5.12 percent, Seoul third with 3.58 percent, Turk in
Turkey fourth with 3.4 percent, and London in fifth place at 2.47
percent. 'As more and more users come online in China, there's a good
chance those computers are using pirated software without up-to-date
security fixes, making them prime targets for hackers who are actually
located elsewhere in the world, [Simon] Heron said. Those compromised
computers, which are used to send spam and make it more difficult to
identify the spammer, are so valuable that hacker gangs have been
competing to take over machines. If one gang finds a machine running
another gang's Trojan horse program — one that appears harmless to the
victim but can be used to control a machine — they'll try to remove the
software.'"

screenshot was made for erotic purposes. The goal is to prevent disturbed
individuals from accessing content online that would trigger violent
behavior. From the article: 'Labour MP Martin Salter, who has worked
closely ... in pushing the legislation, rejected the BDSM community's
claims their civil liberties were being undermined. He said: "No-one is
stopping people doing weird stuff to each other but they would be
strongly advised not to put it on the internet. At the end of the day it
is all too easy for this stuff to trigger an unbalanced mind."' The bill
follows from plans [2]initially announced last August."

[0]coondoggie passed us a NetworkWorld blog post about the [1]incredible
rock-em-sock-em mainframe. Knocked frequently in recent years, the site
notes that IBM's workhorse continues to do important work in a number of
enterprise environments. "While there are some out there who'd like to
see its demise, a true threat to the Big Iron has never really amounted
to much. Even today, the proponents of commodity boxes offering less
expensive x86/x64 or RISC technologies say the mainframe is doomed. But
the facts say otherwise. For example, IBM recently said the mainframe has
achieved three consecutive quarters of growth, marked by new customers
choosing the platform for the first time and existing customers adding
new workloads, such as Linux and Java applications."

telso writes "Microsoft will be [0]opening a new software development
center in Vancouver because of difficulties getting workers into the US.
The company said the center will 'allow the company to continue to
recruit and retain highly skilled people affected by the immigration
issues in the US' It seems possible that shrinking immigration quotas
have affected America's tax and knowledge base."

[0]athloi writes "Despite the tough times for albums, the music industry
is [1]slowly but surely learning the most important lesson of all: give
consumers what they want, and they happily open their wallets. Digital
music sales are a new business and a new way of thinking about and
interacting with content. The industry should be paying closer attention
to its meteoric rise and less attention to the dying, arcane album. It
should absolutely drop the rhetoric about how piracy is destroying the
business, because the sea change in sales patterns shows that something
else is is afoot. It means that when users are sitting at a computer and
looking for music, more and more each year are turning to legal download
services."
